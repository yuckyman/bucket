    "title": "Density-based longitudinal neuron tracking in high-density electrophysiological recordings",
    "content": "Tracking single neurons across days in high-density extracellular recordings is essential for establishing neural mechanisms of learning, memory, and post-injury recovery. However, in weeks-long recordings, identifying cross-day matches among thousands of units is confounded by changes in spike waveforms, unit turnover, and representational drift in neural responses. We introduce DANT (Density-based Across-day Neuron Tracking), an unsupervised framework that jointly estimates probe motion and neuron identity by alternating between density-based clustering in feature space and probe-motion correction inferred from provisional matches. Estimated drift is used to re-register spike waveforms across sessions, after which clustering is recomputed; this iterative loop continues until the set of matches stabilizes. In parallel, DANT learns a decision boundary from match and non-match assignments derived from the clustering results, enabling it to reject low-similarity candidate pairs. Applied to weeks-long Neuropixels recordings from the cortex and striatum in freely moving rats during stable behavior and task switching, DANT substantially increases match yield and reduces false negatives while maintaining a low false-positive rate relative to existing approaches. Together, these results indicate that DANT provides a general, unsupervised solution for longitudinal tracking in chronic, high-density recordings.",

    "title": "Context-dependent low-dimensional neural dynamics unfold in distinct subspaces, dimensionality, and dynamical strength for natural walking and reaching",
    "content": "Awake behaving animal experiments paired with multichannel electrode recordings have advanced motor systems neuroscience in creating models of how the mammalian brain controls movements. However, growing theoretical and experimental evidence question the generalizability of such findings from constrained studies to ambulatory behavior, highlighting a limitation in our understanding of how the brain controls movement. To address this question, spiking neural activity during highly-practiced, routine movement (walking) and goal-directed behavior (reaching towards food) were compared in an unconstrained setting. Kinematic trajectories of the contralateral arm during reaching and walking were statistically similar, as were the average single-neuron firing rates during these respective movements. However, the dimensionality of reaching was higher than that of walking and existed in largely non-overlapping subspaces. Further, when modeled as dynamical systems, reaching decayed 3-5 times more quickly than walking. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the low-dimensional structure of motor cortex is more complex for goal-directed reaching than in highly-practiced natural movements. Since this difference is primarily observable at the state and dynamical systems level, these findings suggest behavioral context plays a significant role in the coordination of otherwise kinematically similar movements, providing indirect evidence for non-cortical circuits such as central pattern generators.",

    "title": "Cografting strategies uncover cell type dependent regulation of dopamine neuron specification and functional maturation in a pre clinical model of Parkinson`s Disease",
    "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the progressive loss of A9 dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to dopamine (DA) depletion in the striatum and subsequent motor symptoms. Transplantation of ventral midbrain-patterned DA (vmDA) progenitors derived from human pluripotent stem cells, aimed at restoring DA neurotransmission in the striatum, is being developed and currently explored in ongoing clinical trials. One factor that may improve the maturation and fate determination of DA neurons in vivo is the intercellular communication within the graft environment, ultimately affecting the therapeutic outcome. In this study, we co-transplanted vmDA progenitors with either glial, ventral forebrain or striatal progenitors into a preclinical xenograft PD model to investigate how these interactions shape the development, maturation, and function of therapeutic DA neurons. Our findings show that co-grafts with ventral forebrain progenitors increase the yield of DA neurons and also promote their functional maturation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that co-grafts with striatal neurons promote functional maturation and the acquisition of DA subtype identity. From these data, we identified EBF3 and PBX3 as candidate transcription factors directing DA neuron maturation and subtype specification, and then functionally validated their role in brain organoids. Taken together, our data highlight that the cellular microenvironment, including specific interactions with neighbouring cells, guides in vivo DA neuron specification and maturation. These findings provide a foundation for developing more refined and effective cell preparations for replacement therapy in PD, and define a conceptual framework that could inform stem cell based strategies for other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems.

    "title": "A rational information gathering account of infant habituation.",
    "content": "Gaze is one of the primary experimental measures for studying cognitive development, especially in preverbal infants. However, the field is only beginning to develop a principled explanatory framework for making sense of the various factors affecting gaze. We approach this issue by addressing infant gaze from first principles, using rational information gathering. In particular, we revisit the influential descriptive account of Hunter and Ames (1988), which posits a set of regularities argued to govern how gaze preference for a stimulus changes with experience and other factors. When the Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) model is reconsidered from the perspective of rational information gathering (as recently also proposed by other authors), one feature of the model emerges as surprising: that preference for a stimulus is not monotonic with exposure. This claim, which has at least some empirical support, is in contrast to most statistical measures of informativeness, which strictly decline with experience. We present a normative, computational theory of visual exploration that rationalizes this and other features of the classic account. Our account suggests that Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) signature nonmonotonic pattern is a direct manifestation of a ubiquitous principle of the value of information in sequential tasks, other consequences of which have recently been observed in a range of settings including deliberation, exploration, curiosity, and boredom. This is that the value of information gathering, putatively driving gaze, depends on the interplay of a stimulus\u2019 informativeness (called gain, the focus of other rationally motivated accounts) with a second factor (called need) reflecting the estimated chance that information will be used in the future. This computational decomposition draws new connections between infant gaze and other cases of exploration, and offers novel, quantitative interpretations and predictions about the factors that may impact infant exploratory attention.

    "content": "Evidence has shown that sex differences affect the symptoms and the response to treatments in neuropsychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Extinction, as a therapeutic method, and reinstatement, as a method that facilitates shock-related memory retrieval, may also be affected by sex differences; however, evidence is sparse. The present study aimed to explore the potential role of sex differences in the effect of extinction and reinstatement on behavioral functions in a rat model of PTSD. Fear learning was induced by three consecutive footshocks (0.8 mA, 3 s, paired with three sounds) on Day 1. Extinction training (20 sounds without footshock) was done 1 hr and 24 hr after footshocks. Reinstatement was done on Day 3, or 10, or 20, or 30, by placing rat in a new context and delivering one footshock (0.8 mA, 3 s, no sound). Results showed that females were more responsive to extinction due to significant decreases in freezing behavior in comparison with males, while reinstatement had more effect to recall shock-related memory in males. Pain threshold was increased and extinction decreased it in both sexes. Locomotion was decreased in fear conditioning group in both sexes and in PTSD + extinction males, while it was not changed in PTSD + extinction females. Reinstatement on Day 3 decreased locomotion in males. Rearing was decreased and extinction restored it in both sexes. By contrast, reinstatement on Day 3 decreased rearing in males. In conclusion, we suggested that females are more responsive to extinction and less sensitive to reinstatement. On the contrary, males are sensitive to reinstatement.

    "content": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, <em>ADCYAP1</em>) is a highly conserved neuropeptide that plays essential roles in numerous physiological functions, and central PACAP signaling has been associated with mechanisms regulating stress-induced psychopathologies. PACAP binds to several receptor subtypes, including PAC1 (<em>ADCYAP1R1</em>), VPAC1 (<em>VIPR1</em>), and VPAC2 (<em>VIPR2</em>), to activate several signaling cascades that can alter neuronal excitability and enhance indices of neuroplasticity, and much of our prior work has suggested that the anxiogenic effects of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) PACAP depend on the activation of PAC1 receptors. To complement our previous work that evaluated the roles of BNST PACAP expression and secretion in anxiety-related responses, we employed in the current work chemogenetic approaches in male PAC1-Ires-Cre mice to directly and specifically modulate the activities of BNST PAC1 receptor-expressing neurons. Inhibition of BNST PAC1 receptor neuron activity with clozapine-N-oxide significantly increased open arm exploration without reducing total locomotor activity; conversely, stimulating BNST PAC1 receptor function significantly reduced open arm exploratory activities. In sum, these data are consistent with our prior work suggesting a key role for BNST PACAP receptor activation in anxiety and stress; further, these observations importantly clarify the neural circuits involved in anxiety-like behaviors.

    "title": "Conditioned place preferences for virtual reality cannabis cues.",
    "content": "This study investigated whether 221 undergraduates (123 males, 98 females) with varying levels of cannabis use displayed a conditioned place preference (CPP) for a virtual reality (VR) room that previously contained virtual cannabis stimuli compared to a neutral VR room that was not paired with cannabis cues. We hypothesized that cannabis-using participants (<em>n</em> = 180) would spend a greater amount of time in, report greater subjective enjoyment in, and explicitly prefer a VR room that was previously paired with virtual cannabis stimuli relative to a neutral room, while participants with nonuse (<em>n</em> = 41) would not. Overall, participants did not demonstrate an implicit or explicit CPP for a VR room that was previously paired with cannabis cues. Interestingly, however, participants with recent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 41) exhibited a significant implicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired VR room, while participants with nonrecent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 113) did not. Furthermore, relative to males with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 93), females with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 87) demonstrated a significant explicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired context as well as significantly greater cannabis cravings. These findings elucidate the need for further research on the role of acute cannabis intoxication, sex, and cue-induced cravings in modulating CPP for cannabis-associated contexts.

    "content": "Environmental threats are typically encountered when animals are searching for food and other necessities. Adaptive behavior must balance competition between fear behavior and reward seeking. We gave rats local neuronal deletions of the ventral pallidum (VP) or specifically deleted paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) neurons projecting directly to the VP. Rats were then assessed in a conditioned suppression procedure in which cues predicting unique foot shock probabilities were presented during, but independent from, reward seeking. Foot shock introduction generally suppressed reward seeking in rats, and recovery from shock introduction was facilitated in rats with VP or PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletions. Discriminative fear was observed in controls, and this fear responding reduced over a single extinction session. VP deletion enhanced extinction fear responding, and PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletion abolished within-session fear reductions. The results demonstrate the VP and its inputs from the PVT shape reward seeking in threat settings and govern fear extinction responding.

    "content": "The ability to engage in everyday tasks, such as walking, requires the integration of cognitive and motor processes. How these processes integrate may be discernable through the relation of brain activity patterns to behavioral performance, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), examination of which has been restricted because of the limitations in experimental design. We related behavior (cognition, walking) to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions (cognition while walking) in healthy young adults. Our probe design enabled us to examine eight regions of interest across PFC and motor cortex to identify key areas related to behavior. Healthy young adults (N = 19) engaged in standing cognition (Serial 3 subtraction), single-task walking, and dual-task walking. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to identify regions associated with increases or decreases in activity under dual-task relative to the other conditions. We observed differences in brain activity patterns by task across multiple regions of interest, mostly in PFC. Specifically, more lateral regions were related to attention-demanding tasks, whereas motor tasks were related to relatively medial regions. Our results relate behavior to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions. Our finding of relatively lateral PFC activity during attention-demanding tasks provides insights into behavioral and brain processes during experimental analogues of everyday activity, bringing us closer to understanding behavior-brain relations in the real world.

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size.

    "title": "Dendrite-targeting OLM interneurons regulate the formation of learning-related CA1 place cell representations",
    "content": "Spatial learning depends on the rapid formation of hippocampal CA1 place cell representations through behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP). BTSP is driven by dendritic calcium plateau potentials in the distal apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons and is thought to arise from the interaction of an excitatory target signal from entorhinal cortex layer 3 (EC3) with inhibitory feedback reflecting the current CA1 population state. However, the cellular source of this feedback remains unknown. To identify this circuit element, we combined in vivo two-photon calcium imaging with bidirectional optogenetic manipulation to examine the role of dendrite-targeting oriens lacunosum-moleculare (OLM) interneurons. We found that axonal and somatic activity of OLM interneurons increased with learning and was spatially biased toward behaviorally salient locations, closely matching the evolving CA1 population representation and the environment-specific EC3 target signal. Causal manipulations revealed that optogenetic silencing of Chrna2alpha-positive OLM interneurons, a genetically defined OLM subset, late in learning increased dendritic plateaus and promoted place cell formation at stimulated locations, whereas activation of the same population early in learning suppressed plateau initiation and place field formation. Together, these findings identify OLM interneurons as the key inhibitory feedback element that dynamically regulates BTSP and stabilizes hippocampal representations during learning.",

This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple. For example, when we looked at single-trial P3b amplitudes, response errors were not lower for trials with larger P3b amplitudes than for trials with smaller P3b amplitudes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1122\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/a7a11955-3619-4499-9ef4-61f72a408561/Figure_5.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1378\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We also used ERP decoding to test whether the exact location of the dot was better stored in working memory on oddball trials than on standard trials (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2023/6/23/decoding-webinar\">click here</a> for information about how ERP decoding works and how you can decode your own data using ERPLAB Toolbox). As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

    "title": "An augmented preference-based Bayesian approach for optimizing neuromodulation stimulation parameters using meta learning",
    "content": "Background. Electrical neuromodulation is increasingly used in the treatment of neurological disorders; however, the selection of stimulation parameters that provide optimal therapeutic benefits remains a major challenge. Moreover, identifying pathological biomarkers linking the effect of stimulation parameters to alleviating symptoms, and hence required for optimizing stimulation parameters, might not always be possible. Objective. We present an augmented, preference-based Bayesian optimization algorithm to optimize stimulation parameters for participants undergoing neuromodulation. This algorithm incorporates two key features: I) It prioritizes the participant\u2019s preferences for stimulation parameters, making it independent of the need for pathological biomarkers. II) It leverages meta learning, using historical participant data to guide the initial optimization for new participants and overcome initial data sparsity. This approach improves both prediction accuracy and convergence speed. Approach. Consider preference training data collected from a set of historical participants who share the same neurological disorder as a new (target) participant. Within that population, there may be different response phenotypes. The goal is to identify historical participants whose stimulation-response phenotype is most similar to the target participant, and leverage their data to accelerate and improve parameter optimization for the target participant. To achieve this, the algorithm iteratively performs a two-step process:(I) a novel, iterative weighting procedure that identifies historical participants with stimulation preferences closest to the target participant, and (II) meta learning that combines the training data of the identified participants with the limited training data of the target participant to train novel, augmented preference learning models. These models are then used to predict the stimulation parameters expected to maximize the target participant\u2019s preference. Mainresults. The proposed algorithm has been validated using synthetically generated data sets that simulate participant preference behavior during neuromodulation. Significance. This approach holds promise for improving personalized neuromodulation therapies and advancing treatment outcomes for neurological disorders without the need for a tedious data collection process and disease-specific pathological biomarkers.",

    "title": "STeCANet: spatio-temporal cross attention network for brain computer interface systems using EEG-fNIRS signals",
    "content": "Objective. Multimodal neuroimaging fusion has shown promise in enhancing brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) performance by capturing complementary neural dynamics. However, most existing fusion frameworks inadequately model the temporal asynchrony and adaptive fusion between electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), thereby limiting their ability to generalize across sessions and subjects. This work aims to develop an adaptive fusion framework that effectively aligns and integrates EEG and fNIRS representations to improve cross-session and cross-subject generalization in BCI applications. Approach. To address this, we propose STeCANet, a novel Spatiotemporal Cross-Attention Network that integrates EEG and fNIRS signals through hierarchical attention-based alignment. The model leverages fNIRS-guided spatial attention, EEG-fNIRS temporal alignment, adaptive fusion, and adversarial training to ensure robust cross-modal interaction and spatiotemporal consistency. Main results. Evaluations across three cognitive paradigms, namely motor imagery, mental arithmetic, and word generation, demonstrate that STeCANet significantly outperforms unimodal and recent multimodal baselines under both session-independent and subject-independent settings. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each sub-module and loss function, including the domain adaptation component, in boosting classification accuracy and robustness. Significance. These results suggest that STeCANet offers a robust and interpretable solution for next-generation BCI applications.",

    "title": "Binocular vision emerges from the coordinated development of orbit convergence, eye orientation, and high-acuity retinal specializations",
    "content": "Binocular vision requires both eyes to be aligned such that their visual fields overlap. A long-standing premise derived from comparative studies is that the orientation of the orbits determines eye position, and thereby the extension of this overlap, the binocular field. In addition, to produce an accurate neural representation, the binocular field must integrate with the position of retinal high-acuity areas and with the extent of uncrossed retinal projections. It remains unknown, however, whether the binocular field is already formed at the time of eye-opening, as well as when and how it integrates with neuroanatomical visual traits during development. Using the diurnal rodent Octodon degus, a suitable animal model for visual neuroscience, we combined CT-based 3D cranial reconstructions, quantitative measurements of visual-field geometry, whole-mount retinal topography, neural tracing of retinal projections, and behavioral assays to reconstruct the postnatal assembly of the binocular visual system. We show that orbital and ocular orientations shift substantially after birth, broadening the dorsal binocular field; that retinal ganglion cell distributions sharpen into a horizontal visual streak and a defined area centralis; and that ipsilateral projections to the superior colliculus mature in parallel to binocular expansion. These changes coincide with the emergence of binocular-dependent behaviors such as depth discrimination and looming-evoked escape responses. Together, our findings demonstrate that binocular vision emerges through the coordinated alignment of multiple developmental processes across levels of organization.",

    "title": "Successful transfer of myoelectric skill from virtual interface to prosthesis control",
    "content": "Objective. Prosthesis control can be seen as a new skill to be learned. To enhance learning, both internal and augmented feedback are exploited. The latter represents external feedback sources that can be designed to enhance learning, e.g. biofeedback. Previous research has shown that augmented feedback protocols can be designed to induce retention by adhering to the guidance hypothesis, but it is not clear yet if that also results in transfer of those skills to prosthesis control. In this study, we test if a training paradigm optimised for retention allows for the transfer of myoelectric skill to prosthesis control. Approach. Twelve limb-intact participants learned a novel myoelectric skill during five one-hour training sessions. To induce retention of the novel myoelectric skill, we used a delayed feedback paradigm. Prosthesis transfer was tested through pre-and post-tests with a prosthesis. Prosthesis control tests included a grasp matching task, the modified box and blocks test, and an object manipulation task, requiring five grasps in total (\u2018power\u2019, \u2018tripod\u2019, \u2018pointer\u2019, \u2018lateral grip\u2019, and \u2018hand open\u2019). Main results. We found that prosthesis control improved significantly following five days of training. Importantly, the prosthesis control metrics were significantly related to the retention metric during training, but not to the prosthesis performance during the pre-test. Significance. This study shows that transfer of novel, abstract myoelectric control from a computer interface to prosthetic control is possible if the training paradigm is designed to induce retention. These results highlight the importance of approaching myoelectric and prosthetic skills from a skill acquisition standpoint, and open up new avenues for the design of prosthetic training protocols.",

    "title": "Intracranial hypotension headache complicated by retroclival subdural hematoma: clinical insights and literature review",
    "content": "BackgroundRetroclival subdural hematoma (rcSDH) secondary to spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is an exceedingly rare clinical entity, characterized by complex and incompletely understood pathophysiological mechanisms.CaseA 24-year-old female presented with acute and persistent orthostatic headache, with no history of trauma or anticoagulant therapy. Neuroimaging revealed subdural hematomas (SDH) located in the retroclival, infratentorial, and right frontal regions. It was hypothesized that veinous rupture, resulting from venous traction due to decreased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, was the underlying mechanism. Following epidural blood patch (EBP) therapy, the patient exhibited marked symptomatic improvement and radiological resolution of hematomas on follow-up imaging.ConclusionRcSDH is considered an uncommon complication of SIH, potentially resulting from venous rupture in the retroclival subdural space due to reduced CSF pressure. SIH should be considered in cases of rcSDH. The treatment is typically focused on addressing the underlying etiology, with early diagnosis and timely intervention being essential for achieving favorable outcomes. In cases of severe brainstem compression, hematoma evacuation should be performed in conjunction with EBP.",

    "title": "Skull stripping tools in pediatric T2-weighted MRI scans: a retrospective evaluation of segmentation performance",
    "content": "IntroductionFor brain maturity assessment of infants aged above 6 months, T2-weighted MRI scans are recommended. Prior to automated brain tissue analysis, skull stripping is typically applied. However, most skull stripping tools neither focus on T2-weighted scans nor on pediatric cohorts. Here, we present the evaluation results of seven common skull stripping tools in a comparably large pediatric cohort.MethodsThis study is based on 199 T2-weighted scans of children under the age of 5 years retrospectively acquired from the clinical routine at Hannover Medical School. We established a manually labeled ground truth under quality control of a senior neuroradiologist specialized in pediatric neuroradiology and evaluated seven skull stripping tools (BET, ROBEX, HD-BET, HD-BET-fast, SynthStrip, SynthStrip-noCSF and d-SynthStrip). Segmentation performance (Dice score, 95th percentile Hausdorff distance, sensitivity, specificity) and computation time were assessed on non-preprocessed and preprocessed scans (zero padding, contrast enhancement, artifact removal and normalization) as well as in different brain regions. For the best performing model, we manually assessed the top and bottom quartile of segmentations with respect to the integrity of different anatomical brain structures.ResultsOnly BET, HD-BET, HD-BET-fast profited from data preprocessing. Considering this, all models had median Dice scores between 0.88 and 0.96, with SynthStrip performing best. All models segmented most accurately in the middle axial slices of the brain. Resampling lowered the performance of all models, except ROBEX. Mean computing times ranged from 2\u202fs (BET) to 132\u202fs (HD-BET) with SynthStrip requiring 7\u202fs. per scan. SynthStrip was prone to not entirely including the Sinus sagittalis superior, the upper Cerebrum, the temporal pole, the Cerebellum and the Chiasma opticum/pituitary gland. In contrast, the petrous bone and the skull in the middle axial slices have often been partly included.DiscussionDue to its robustness and quick computation time, we recommend SynthStrip for skull stripping of pediatric T2-weighted MRI scans. We attribute the observed segmentation errors to the partial volume effect, which should be addressed in future research. Limitations of our study include the monocentric setting, the exclusion of pathological cases and the skewed age distribution in our cohort.",

    "content": "IntroductionIn this study, we propose a data-driven approach that integrates behavioral diagnosis with neuroimaging features to identify representative UWS and MCS patients from a large inpatient cohort.MethodsClinical information was extracted using a subset of UWS patients with CRS-R scores \u2264 5. Neuroimaging biomarkers were established as the increased and decreased functional connectivity indices of anatomically defined regions covering the whole brain. The algorithm was implemented through an iterative refinement process that converged on a division of UWS and MCS patients into representative and excluded (or nonrepresentative) patient groups.ResultsThirty-one out of 58 UWS patients and 23 out of 30 MCS patients were identified as representative, with an average classification accuracy of 90.2% in differentiating between the two groups. In contrast, differentiating between excluded UWS patients (n =\u202f27) and representative MCS patients (n =\u202f23) and between all UWS (n =\u202f58) and MCS (n =\u202f30) patients produced average classification accuracies of 50.9 and 64.3%, respectively. Furthermore, altered DMN functional connectivity between representative UWS and MCS patients revealed a consistent pattern as shown in prior studies, while comparisons involving excluded patients did not.DiscussionThese results highlight the value of integrating behavioral scores and neural connectivity features for DOC classification, providing a more coherent basis for downstream analysis and machine-learning applications in DOC classification.",

    "title": "An automated workflow for quantifying the formation of synuclein aggregates in human dopaminergic neurons",
    "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by alpha-synuclein (-syn) aggregates termed Lewy bodies. To model PD pathology in vitro, preformed fibrils of -syn (PFFs), which can be taken up by cells, provide a seed that drives misfolding and aggregation of endogenous -syn, with new aggregates amplifying this process. External application of PFFs to dopaminergic neurons (DNs) increases aggregate formation, marked by -syn phosphorylation at serine 129 (pS129-syn), a pathological PD marker. Building on this, we developed an automated synuclein seeding assay to quantify new -syn aggregates in iPSC-derived DNs. Using pS129-syn as a readout, we show that PFFs elicit a time- and dose-dependent increase in pS129-syn aggregates. Our high-throughput assay further revealed that aggregate formation depends on endogenous -syn levels. Treatment with PFFs produced a greater increase in pS129-syn aggregates in iPSC DNs derived from a PD patient with a triplication in the SNCA gene, which encodes the -syn protein and which elevates total -syn levels, relative to DNs from an isogenic iPSC line from the same individual, in which the SNCA gene mutation had been corrected by CRISPR/Cas9. In contrast, no pS129-syn signal was detected in neurons in which all copies of the SNCA gene had been knocked out (KO). This high-content imaging assay for synuclein seeding offers a platform for assessing compounds and therapeutics that may impede -syn aggregate formation.",

    "title": "Neurocognition, cerebellar functions and psychiatric features in spinocerebellar ataxia type 34: a case series",
    "content": "ObjectiveThis study primarily aimed to comprehensively characterize the neurological, neuroradiological and neurocognitive profiles, as well psychiatric features of individuals with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 34 (SCA34) associated with pathogenic variants in the ELOVL4 gene. Secondarily, we investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functions and cerebellar morphology in individuals with SCA34 by correlating structural changes to cognitive performance. Given involvement of the cerebellum in SCA34, our findings will contribute to a broader understanding of the role of the cerebellum in cognition.MethodsFour individuals (52 f, 72\u2009m, 76\u2009m, 76 f) underwent DNA testing using Next-Generation Sequencing and detailed assessment of neurocognitive functions. The test battery evaluated all six cognitive domains: verbal functions, executive functions, attention and processing speed, learning and memory, visuospatial perception and abilities, and social cognition. In addition, cerebellar and motor functions were evaluated using Finger Tapping, Prism Adaptation, and the Motor Speed subtest of the Delis-Kaplan executive function system (D-KEFS). Test results were compared with each individual\u2019s estimated premorbid cognitive level, determined from their highest educational attainment or occupational status prior to disease onset. Psychiatric symptoms related to anxiety, depression, and sleep were reported using clinical scales. The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) was used to assess ataxia severity. Two individuals and one matched control underwent high-resolution 7T MRI to characterize cerebellar morphology.ResultsNeurocognitive assessments identified cognitive and motor dysfunction across all individuals, including distinct neurocognitive impairments consistent with cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome (CCAS), along with additional deficits in learning, visual and verbal episodic memory, emotion recognition\u2014a component of social cognition. Anxiety and sleep disturbance, but not depression, were observed in both female participants. High-resolution 7\u2009T MRI revealed structural cerebellar alterations, with moderate to severe bilateral cerebellar atrophy, including the vermis and multiple lobules (Crus II, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, IX), as well as atrophy of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, accompanied by mild pontine atrophy. Genetic analyses confirmed the involvement of ELOVL4-related disruptions in long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis, offering insight into the molecular underpinnings of cerebellar degeneration in SCA34.ConclusionIndividuals with SCA34 show cerebellar degeneration accompanied by cognitive, motor, and social-affective impairments consistent with CCAS. Atrophy of the vermis, multiple lobules, and cerebellar peduncles align with these deficits, highlighting the cerebellum\u2019s key role in cognition. ELOVL4-related disruptions in fatty acid biosynthesis provides insight into the molecular basis of SCA34. Together, these findings advance our understanding of how cerebellar pathology contributes to complex neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms in genetic ataxias.",

    "content": "IntroductionThe application of motor imagery in human\u2013computer interaction and rehabilitative medicine has attracted growing attention due to recent advances in brain\u2013computer interface technologies. However, traditional EEG decoding paradigms based on fixed frequency\u2013band segmentation often exhibit limited performance because they fail to capture individual variability in brain rhythms.MethodsThis work proposes an adaptive method that integrates the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) with Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) to optimize sub\u2013band segmentation for motor imagery EEG decoding. SSA adaptively searches for optimal sub\u2013band boundaries, enabling individualized frequency\u2013band selection.ResultsExperiments on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset under a cross\u2013session evaluation protocol (training on session T, testing on session E) demonstrated that SSA\u2013FBCSP effectively improves frequency\u2013band adaptability. The SSA\u2013FBCSP approach was further combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and k\u2013Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers to evaluate the influence of different downstream classifiers.ConclusionAmong them, SSA\u2013FBCSP\u2013LDA achieved the best performance, outperforming the conventional uniform sub\u2013band approach by 21.76% and reaching an average accuracy of 89.92%. The adaptively selected sub\u2013bands closely matched the ERD/ERS distribution, confirming the method\u2019s effectiveness in frequency\u2013band optimization. Compared with recent deep\u2013learning\u2013based MI\u2013EEG models, the proposed technique offers a balance of accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency, providing a promising direction for personalized brain\u2013computer interface systems.",

These discrepancies underscore the need for a systematic, quantitative synthesis of existing data to clarify the impact of DBS across different motor domains.ObjectiveTo systematically evaluate the effects of DBS on motor symptoms in PD by analyzing UPDRS-III scores and conducting subgroup analyses based on stimulation target, stimulation type, and medication status.MethodsA literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies on clinical trials and observational studies reporting pre- and post-DBS motor assessments in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science from inception to 15 December 2024.ResultsA total of 35 studies comprising 1,082 PD patients were included. The pooled analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in overall UPDRS-III scores post-DBS (WMD: = \u22121.09, 95% CI: \u22121.32 to \u22120.87, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Subgroup analyses showed consistent improvements across tremor, rigidity, akinesia, bradykinesia, dyskinesia, and axial symptoms, regardless of stimulation target or medication state. UPDRS Part IV scores also significantly improved, reflecting reduced motor complications. However, speech function remained unchanged, and UPDRS Part I scores initially showed no significant improvement, though significance emerged after removing sources of heterogeneity.ConclusionDBS significantly improves overall motor function, particularly tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. However, its effects on gait and speech remain inconsistent, which shows the need for further research to refine patient selection and optimize stimulation parameters. These findings provide valuable insights into the therapeutic impact of DBS in PD management.",

    "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD), a synucleopathy characterized by the presence of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) aggregates in the brain, is thought to originate in the intestine. Desulfovibrio, resident gut sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), usually found in very low numbers in a healthy gut, are found in higher numbers in PD. In a recent study, a separate group demonstrated that Desulfovibrio isolated from both PD patients and healthy subjects were fed to C. elegans and were found to increase \u03b1-syn aggregates in the head region of the worms. How these bacteria induce \u03b1-syn aggregates in the brain through the gut remain unknown. We tested whether Desulfovibrio induced \u03b1-syn aggregates in the intestinal cells and triggered \u03b1-syn secretion from these cells into the growth medium and whether this growth medium (devoid of bacteria) further induced \u03b1-syn aggregates in neurons. We also tested whether Desulfovibrio directly induced \u03b1-syn aggregates in neuronal cells and inhibited protein expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a key dopamine-producing enzyme. We also tested whether Desulfovibrio increased \u03b1-syn levels in intestine, plasma, and in brain in mice.MethodsEnteroendocrine STC-1 and neuronal SH-Sy5y cells were infected with Desulfovibriovulgaris (DSV). We measured \u03b1-syn aggregation by immunofluorescence. \u03b1-syn levels in cell culture supernatant (sup), tissues, and plasma were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Protein expression of TH and \u03b1-syn was analyzed by Western blot.ResultsWe found that DSV increased the number of STC-1cells with \u03b1-syn aggregates and also induced \u03b1-syn expression in these cells. Sup from DSV-infected STC-1 had higher \u03b1-syn levels compared to control uninfected sup and could induce \u03b1-syn aggregates in SH-Sy5y. DSV also directly induced a syn aggregates and inhibited TH in SH-Sy5y. DSV-gavaged mice had higher levels of \u03b1-syn in the duodenum, plasma, and in brain and also showed a decreasing trend in TH expression in the brain.ConclusionThus, our findings provide a gut-to-brain link tied to the ability of SRB in the gut-to increase expression, aggregation and spread of \u03b1-syn and decrease of TH in PD.",

    "title": "Integrated auditory-vocal embodied training for expressive authentic intonation in Chinese zither performance",
    "content": "BackgroundChinese zither music relies on culturally specific microtones (e. g., FA+ and TI\u2013) that differ from Western equal temperament, yet prolonged exposure to standardized tuning often leads to the erosion of these traditional intonation practices. While embodied cognition theory emphasizes the role of sensorimotor integration in learning, its application to the acquisition of non-fixed pitch systems in intangible cultural heritage music remains underexplored.ObjectiveThis study aimed to examine whether a structured auditory-vocal embodied training protocol\u2014integrating listening, vocal imitation, and metaphoric gestures\u2014could enhance zither learners' accuracy in producing traditional microtones, and to provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of embodied cognition theory in sustaining culturally authentic musical intonation.MethodsA quasi-experimental design was employed with 63 intermediate-level zither students. Participants were assigned to an experimental group, which completed a 1-week auditory-vocal-gestural training program, or a control group, which continued regular practice without multimodal integration. Pitch accuracy on two critical tones (FA+ and TI\u2013) was assessed through pre- and post-tests.ResultsThe experimental group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in Chinese-style pitch accuracy compared to the control group, along with a marked shift in intonation perception away from equal-tempered biases.ConclusionThe findings indicate that multisensory embodied training, grounded in the principles of perceptual-motor coupling and gestural simulation, effectively promotes the internalization of traditional microtonal intonation. This study not only offers a novel pedagogical approach for preserving intangible cultural heritage in music education but also substantiates the role of embodied cognition in acquiring culturally situated sensorimotor skills.",

    "title": "Automated brain atrophy quantification from clinical MRI predicts early neurological deterioration in anterior choroidal artery territory infarction",
    "content": "BackgroundEarly neurological deterioration (END) occurs in 43%\u201360% of patients with anterior choroidal artery (AChA) territory infarction. While brain atrophy serves as an imaging biomarker of diminished brain reserve capacity and may influence stroke outcomes, its predictive value for END in AChA infarction remains unclear.MethodsThis dual-center retrospective cohort study consecutively enrolled patients with acute AChA territory infarction admitted to two Chinese stroke centers between September 2018 and September 2024. Clinical T1-weighted images were reconstructed into standardized high-resolution images using the SynthSR deep learning algorithm, followed by fully automated brain tissue segmentation via AssemblyNet. We calculated gray matter fraction (GMF), white matter fraction (WMF), brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), and cerebrospinal fluid fraction (CSFF) to quantify brain atrophy severity. Multivariable logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses were employed to assess associations between brain atrophy metrics and END.ResultsAmong 206 enrolled patients, 78 (37.86%) developed END. Patients with END demonstrated significantly greater brain atrophy: GMF (P < 0.001), WMF (P < 0.001), and BPF (P < 0.001) were all significantly reduced, while CSFF was correspondingly elevated (P < 0.001). In fully adjusted models, each 0.01-unit increase in WMF was associated with a 58% reduction in END risk (P < 0.001); each 0.01-unit increase in BPF corresponded to a 32% risk reduction (P = 0.002); and each 0.01-unit increase in CSFF was associated with a 52% increase in risk (P < 0.001). Quartile analysis confirmed dose-response relationships: the highest quartiles of WMF and BPF were associated with 91% and 74% reductions in END risk, respectively, while the highest CSFF quartile conferred a 6.2-fold increased risk. RCS analysis confirmed significant linear dose-response relationships between both BPF and CSFF with END (both P-non-linear > 0.05).ConclusionAutomated brain atrophy quantification based on routine clinical MRI can independently predict END risk in patients with AChA infarction, providing a feasible imaging biomarker for this high-risk stroke population and facilitating early risk stratification and treatment optimization.",

    "content": "Moderate-volume brainstem hemorrhage (>5 mL) typically carries an extremely poor prognosis. This article presents a rare case of survival following a large-volume brainstem hemorrhage with therapeutic intervention. A 47-year-old male with hypertension presented with sudden-onset coma. CT imaging revealed a 10.3 mL brainstem hemorrhage. The patient underwent hematoma puncture drainage and tracheostomy, accompanied by hemostatic therapy, intracranial pressure reduction, anti-infection treatment, and neurorehabilitation. During treatment, the patient developed recurrent multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. After 2 months, the patient gradually regained consciousness with improved limb muscle strength, though exhibiting motor aphasia, dysphagia, and urinary/fecal incontinence. Rehabilitation therapy was continued. This case demonstrates that even with large-volume brainstem hemorrhage, comprehensive management including timely drainage, intracranial pressure control, tracheostomy, infection management, and early rehabilitation may achieve survival and consciousness recovery. However, as a single-case report, this study has limited sample size, necessitating further large-scale randomized controlled trials to validate these findings.",

    "title": "Inhibition of histone lysine demethylase restores learning and memory in aged mice",
    "content": "Chromatin undergoes dramatic changes during the ageing process. In the brain, these chromatin changes are thought to underlie age-associated deficits in the activity-dependent gene transcription necessary for memory consolidation. Here, we show that the levels of a specific histone post-translational modification, trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4me3) is markedly increased in the hippocampus of aged mice and that the activity-induced increase in H3K4me3 that is observed in response to a learning stimulus in young mice, is severely blunted in the aged hippocampus. H3K4me3 typically marks open, accessible chromatin at the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of actively transcribed genes. We identify altered H3K4me3 peaks at TSSs and show that ca. 90% of the activity-induced H3K4me3 changes at TSSs are either absent or reduced in the aged hippocampus. To understand the biological significance of these age-associated changes, we screened a library of pharmacological compounds for compounds that can alter H3K4me3 levels in hippocampal neurons. We show that treatment of aged mice with one of these, the LSD1 inhibitor ORY-1001, restored normal learning and memory in object location and recognition tasks. Furthermore, we show that ORY-1001 treatment increased long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity deficient in the aged hippocampus. These findings suggest that targeting the epigenetic machinery that regulates activity-dependent gene transcription may represent an avenue for treating age-associated cognitive impairment.",

    "content": "We investigated how combining transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with closed-loop acoustic stimulation (CLAS) during slow-wave sleep (SWS) affects memory consolidation and sleep-related neural oscillations. Cathodal tDCS was used to slightly reduce cortical excitability, thereby simulating a shifted brain state during CLAS and allowing us to compare the effects of standard CLAS to CLAS delivered under altered cortical conditions (CmodCLAS). Twenty-three participants [mean age (SD) 21.3 (2.6) years] completed two experimental nights: one with CLAS alone and one with CLAS combined with cathodal tDCS (CmodCLAS). Overnight retention on declarative memory tasks and morning learning performance were assessed. Memory outcomes revealed that CmodCLAS, but not CLAS alone, significantly improved overnight retention on the figural paired-associate task. In the EEG, CmodCLAS shifted the time-locked response to acoustic stimulation toward more negative potential values at the frontal region. CmodCLAS also prolonged slow oscillation (SO) duration at frontal sites while shortening SO duration at occipital sites, an effect not observed during standard CLAS. These findings demonstrate that the baseline level of cortical excitability during sleep modulates both the cognitive and electrophysiological effects of CLAS. They highlight the importance of brain state for non-invasive CLAS during sleep and suggest that CmodCLAS may serve as a useful approach for enhancing prefrontal cortical function during SWS.",

    "title": "A neurorecording toolkit for longitudinal assessments of transplanted human cortical organoids in vivo",
    "content": "Human cortical organoids (hCOs) are three-dimensional neural cell aggregates that recapitulate certain structural and functional aspects of the developing human cortex. Xenotransplantation of hCOs into the rodent brain enables human-centric modeling of neurodevelopmental processes in a physiologically relevant environment. Here, we present a neurorecording toolkit for longitudinal structural and functional assessment of hCO xenografts as they mature in vivo. Single hCOs were implanted into the retrosplenial cortex of adult immunodeficient mice and monitored for up to 8 months. Optical coherence tomography was used for label-free imaging of xenograft vascularization and structure, enabling quantitative assessments of capillary density and graft volume. To probe neuronal activity, human neurons were labeled with a calcium sensor before implantation using either adeno-associated or lentivirus for sparse or dense neuronal labeling, respectively. Fluorescent imaging was conducted using two-photon, widefield, and swept confocally-aligned planar excitation microscopy for single cell, whole-graft, and volumetric calcium imaging, respectively. Results from these modalities indicate an increase in neuronal activity and synchronicity over time during in vivo graft maturation. Further, we chronically implanted surface graphene microelectrode arrays (gMEAs) and performed recordings of xenograft and host local field potential signals simultaneously with 2P calcium imaging, confirming the spatial localization and human origin of electrical signals recorded at the xenograft surface.",

    "title": "Adjacent Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) Regions Participate in Distinct Large-Scale Networks Differentially Recruited for Social and Cognitive Control Functions",
    "content": "Human prefrontal cortex (PFC) is heterogenous. In monkeys, side-by-side PFC regions, including within dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), show distinct long-range anatomical projection profiles, raising the possibility that adjacent regions might specialize as a consequence of the distributed networks in which they are embedded. Consistent with this possibility, recent findings in humans provide evidence for PFC regions domain-specialized for scene (spatial) processing and language processing that are adjacent to distinct domain-flexible regions responding to traditional cognitive control demands. Here we tested functional specialization of PFC regions linked to another domain-specialized network recruited by certain forms of social processing (theory-of-mind, ToM, tasks). Using within-individual precision neuroimaging approaches, side-by-side DLPFC regions embedded within parallel distributed networks were identified within the idiosyncratic anatomy of each individual (N=13). Functional responses between these distinct regions revealed a robust functional double dissociation: one DLPFC region was preferentially recruited by ToM tasks and an adjacent DLPFC region by working memory task demands. The region responding to social processing demands was small and its position varied slightly from one person to the next suggesting why it may have been underappreciated in past group-based analyses. These findings add to evidence that PFC features more functional specialization than commonly appreciated and further that the specialization of juxtaposed regions within PFC can be understood by examining the distributed networks within which the regions are embedded.",

    "title": "Anatomical White Matter Tracts Span the Cortical Hierarchy to Support Cognitive Diversity",
    "content": "Long-range white matter (WM) tracts support cognition by enabling communication between distant cortical regions, which are organized along a hierarchy defined by the sensorimotor-to-association (S-A) axis. However, it remains unknown how WM tracts are positioned within the cortical hierarchy to support cognition. Here, we show that WM tracts are differentially positioned in the cortical hierarchy to support specific cognitive functions, and that tracts spanning the hierarchy connect regions with greater cognitive diversity. Moreover, tracts situated within the same hierarchical level connect biologically similar regions, while those crossing the hierarchy bridge distinct biological milieux to support diverse cognitive functions. The placement of tracts in the cortical hierarchy also reflects developmental variation in tract microstructure and individual differences in cognition. Together, these findings provide a framework that moves beyond conventional categories of association or projection tracts and links WM tract anatomy to cortical organization, cognitive function, cortical neurobiology, and neurodevelopment. We anticipate that this cortex-anchored framework for describing WM tracts may aid the interpretation of individual differences in WM structure related to development and behavior.",

    "title": "Integration of gene expression with computational modeling reveals region-specific brain energy metabolism dysregulation in schizophrenia",
    "content": "Schizophrenia is a highly heritable psychiatric disorder with suggested disturbances in multiple neurobiological pathways including brain energy metabolism, which is essential for sustaining precise neuronal signaling. The relationship between gene expression alterations and energy metabolism defects, however, is poorly understood. Here we combined differential expression (DE) analysis with computational modeling to investigate how the expression of cytosolic energy metabolism-associated genes influences the concentrations of key energy metabolites. The DE analysis used human post-mortem RNA sequencing data from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) from the Common Mind Consortium. Metabolic simulations were carried out using a biophysical model of brain energy metabolism (Winter et al. 2018). We conducted both population-average and subject-specific simulations and assessed the effects of DE genes individually and collectively.  The DE analysis identified nine genes in the ACC and 24 in the DLPFC. Approximately two thirds of the DE genes were downregulated in schizophrenia in both brain areas. Decreased expression of neuronal  LDHB  in the ACC caused a decrease of pyruvate and an increase of NAD+/NADH ratio. Furthermore, decreased expression of neuronal PFKM in the DLPFC caused an increase of glucose and NAD+/NADH ratio and a decrease of pyruvate, lactate, and ATP. These findings provide evidence for region-specific dysregulation of brain energy metabolism in schizophrenia and suggest mechanistic links between gene expression changes and altered levels of key energy metabolites.",

    "title": "Amyloid-beta relates to default and attention network connectivity during working memory retrieval",
    "content": "As one of the earliest pathological events in Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-beta accumulation has been linked to alterations in large-scale brain networks, especially the default mode network. While most prior work has focused on resting-state functional connectivity or task-evoked activation, how amyloid-beta relates to task-modulated connectivity that directly supports behavior is less explored. Here, we examined the relationship between amyloid-beta burden and task-modulated connectivity during a Letter Sternberg verbal working-memory task in eighty-four cognitively normal older adults from an ongoing longitudinal cohort (age 56-71 years; 41 female). To further understand these connectivity alterations, we tested whether these connections were associated with task performance or with cognitive reserve factors. We found that higher amyloid-beta burden was associated with reduced connectivity specifically during the probe phase of working-memory retrieval. At the regional scale, lower node strength in posterior-medial regions of the default mode network was related to worse task performance and mediated the amyloid-behavior relationship. At the network scale, altered coupling between the default mode and dorsal attention networks was related to task performance but did not mediate the amyloid-behavior relationship. Moreover, physical activity was associated with network-level coupling but not with regional node strength. These findings suggest that amyloid-beta burden disrupts retrieval-related working-memory systems, particularly regions of the default mode network that are vulnerable to amyloid-beta, while coupling between the default mode and dorsal attention networks indexes resilience. Collectively, task-modulated connectivity provides insight into pathways through which early Alzheimer's disease pathology influences working-memory performance and resilience and may inform targeted lifestyle or neuromodulation interventions for older adults.",

    "content": "With the onset of ageing the likelihood of brain degeneration increases but so does the remarkable capability of the brain to reorganize itself termed as neurocognitive resilience. Leveraging the neuroimaging mapped anatomical signatures to demarcate age related alteration of an individual brain is a promising strategy to identify ageing phenotypes and estimate the molecular cues account for coping mechanisms. This study endeavour to identifying neuroprotective signatures using multimodal structural and functional brain scans of healthy aged male and female cohort across dorsal-ventral pathways of neuronal signal processing. To obtain multifarious insight across numerous patho physiological process we employed cutting edge approaches such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional MRI (fMRI) and vascular MRI (cerebrovascular reactivity). From the study we obtained several unexpected anatomical and physiological neuro-protective features in the older cohort. Overall, we observed that older cohort exhibit better circum-cerebral structural connectivity as (i) cuneus to superior frontal gyrus (ii) superior frontal gyrus to inferior frontal gyrus (iii) inferior temporal gyrus to inferior frontal gyrus and (iv) cuneus to inferior temporal gyrus. Another, significant neuroprotective anatomical signature was revealed, namely a connectivity through vertical occipital fasciculus across cuneus to temporal cortex in male and female older cohort. Additionally, in older female we observed a pronounced increment in overall functional connectivity network observed in inferior frontal gyrus (both hemispheres). Whereas in older male a substantial increment of functional connectivity network in cuneus was observed as compared to their younger counterpart.",

    "content": "Singing and speaking often dissociate clinically--people who stutter can sing fluently, and individuals with aphasia and speech output problems from stroke may express sentences fluently in song--yet the neural mechanisms of this centuries-old clinical phenomenon remain unclear. We recorded intracranial EEG while neurosurgical patients produced matched sentences by singing or speaking, sampling millimeter- and millisecond-scale activity across bilateral sensorimotor cortex (SMC). During articulation, high-frequency activity (70-150 Hz) lateralized oppositely across behaviors, with right-dominant SMC activation for singing and left-dominant activation for speaking. Mu-band (~10 Hz) synchrony further differentiated the dynamics: speaking showed an early left-led pattern, whereas singing exhibited a ramping of synchrony within the left sensorimotor cortex and between the two motor cortices, supporting progressive interhemispheric recruitment. Frequency-domain Granger-Geweke causality revealed that the left primary somatosensory cortex drives both motor cortices at speech onset. In contrast in singing, control over motor cortices relied on both hemispheres. These results provide evidence that song and speech rely on dissociable sensorimotor dynamics. This bilaterally coordinated SMC pathway may enable preserved singing in individuals with impaired speech output.",

    "title": "From iPSCs to NPCs to cortical neurons: bioenergetic, neuronal, and calcium signaling phenotypes in bipolar disorder with and without familial mitochondrial disease",
    "content": "Background: Psychiatric disorders frequently accompany primary mitochondrial diseases (PMDs), implicating mitochondrial dysfunction as a shared biological substrate for psychiatric vulnerability. To determine how familial mitochondrial risk influences neuronal development in bipolar disorder (BD), we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), neural progenitor cells (NPCs), and cortical neurons (CNs) from three healthy controls (CT), three patients with BD, and three patients with BD and a family history of mitochondrial disease (BD-FMD). Methods: Across differentiation, we assessed mitochondrial function (ATP production, mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS generation, cytosolic cell-free mtDNA), metabolomic signatures, calcium imaging, and neuronal electrophysiological activity through multi-electrode arrays (MEA). Results: BD neurons uniquely exhibited pronounced hyperexcitability in comparison to CT and BD-FMD groups. The BD-FMD group displayed prolonged mitochondrial calcium transients, altered membrane potential, and aberrant ROS, in comparison to CT and BD, consistent with a sustained energetic deficit. Metabolomic profiling revealed distinct pathway enrichments in BD and BD-FMD, indicating divergent bioenergetic adaptations to mitochondrial burden. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that familial mitochondrial liability actively reshapes neuronal differentiation and function, producing distinct trajectories of mitochondrial performance, calcium signaling, and network excitability. These results suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction in BD is not a secondary byproduct of illness, but a mechanistic contributor to altered neuronal energetics and communication. Together, these findings delineate how inherited mitochondrial vulnerability reshapes neuronal excitability and metabolism, revealing bioenergetic phenotypes that may inform precision stratification and therapeutic targeting in BD.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.18920v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: When exploring data, analysts construct narratives about what the data means by asking questions, generating visualizations, reflecting on patterns, and revising their interpretations as new insights emerge. Yet existing analysis tools treat narrative as an afterthought, breaking the link between reasoning, reflection, and the evolving story from exploration. Consequently, analysts lose the ability to see how their reasoning evolves, making it harder to reflect systematically or build coherent explanations. To address this gap, we propose Narrative Scaffolding, a framework for narrative-driven exploration that positions narrative construction as the primary interface for exploration and reasoning. We implement this framework in a system that externalizes iterative reasoning through narrative-first entry, semantically aligned view generation, and reflection support via insight provenance and inquiry tracking. In a within-subject study N=20, we demonstrate that narrative scaffolding facilitates broader exploration, deeper reflection, and more defensible narratives. An evaluation with visualization literacy experts (N = 6) confirmed that the system produced outputs aligned with narrative intent and facilitated intentional exploration.",

Study 1 reports short interviews with residents about how they store, sort, and dispose of plastic packaging in their homes. The findings highlight recurring frictions: limited space, improvised storage, uncertainty about correct sorting, and difficulties with bulky or dirty items. Study 2 focuses on laundry detergent packaging as a common source of large plastic containers. Participants' purchase decisions prioritised price and cleaning performance, while expressing concern for environmental impact and confusion about materials, rinsing, and recyclability.\n  Building on these insights, four student groups designed interactive recycling concepts that combine physical bins or bags with mobile applications. The concepts explore modular storage, sensing and compaction, playful feedback, and reward schemes to support domestic recycling routines. Together, the studies and concepts point to design opportunities at the intersection of packaging, home infrastructure, and digital services, while also raising questions about feasibility, privacy, and the cost of new devices.",

    "title": "DASH: Deception-Augmented Shared Mental Model for a Human-Machine Teaming System",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.18616v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present DASH (Deception-Augmented Shared mental model for Human-machine teaming), a novel framework that enhances mission resilience by embedding proactive deception into Shared Mental Models (SMM). Designed for mission-critical applications such as surveillance and rescue, DASH introduces \"bait tasks\" to detect insider threats, e.g., compromised Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), AI agents, or human analysts, before they degrade team performance. Upon detection, tailored recovery mechanisms are activated, including UGV system reinstallation, AI model retraining, or human analyst replacement. In contrast to existing SMM approaches that neglect insider risks, DASH improves both coordination and security. Empirical evaluations across four schemes (DASH, SMM-only, no-SMM, and baseline) show that DASH sustains approximately 80% mission success under high attack rates, eight times higher than the baseline. This work contributes a practical human-AI teaming framework grounded in shared mental models, a deception-based strategy for insider threat detection, and empirical evidence of enhanced robustness under adversarial conditions. DASH establishes a foundation for secure, adaptive human-machine teaming in contested environments.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.18413v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Earable acoustic sensing offers a powerful and non-invasive modality for capturing fine-grained auditory and physiological signals directly from the ear canal, enabling continuous and context-aware monitoring of cognitive states. As earable devices become increasingly embedded in daily life, they provide a unique opportunity to sense mental effort and perceptual load in real time through auditory interactions. In this study, we present the first investigation of cognitive load inference through auditory perception using acoustic signals captured by off-the-shelf in-ear devices. We designed speech-based listening tasks to induce varying levels of cognitive load, while concurrently embedding acoustic stimuli to evoke Stimulus Frequency Otoacoustic Emission (SFOAEs) as a proxy for cochlear responsiveness. Statistical analysis revealed a significant association (p < 0.01) between increased cognitive load and changes in auditory sensitivity, with 63.2% of participants showing peak sensitivity at 3 kHz. Notably, sensitivity patterns also varied across demographic subgroups, suggesting opportunities for personalized sensing.

    "title": "Exploration vs. Fixation: Scaffolding Divergent and Convergent Thinking for Human-AI Co-Creation with Generative Models",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.18388v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Generative AI has begun to democratize creative work, enabling novices to produce complex artifacts such as code, images, and videos. However, in practice, existing interaction paradigms often fail to support divergent exploration: users tend to converge too quickly on early ``good enough'' results and struggle to move beyond them, leading to premature convergence and design fixation that constrains their creative potential. To address this, we propose a structured, process-oriented human-AI co-creation paradigm including divergent and convergent thinking stages, grounded in Wallas's model of creativity. To avoid design fixation, our paradigm scaffolds both high-level exploration of conceptual ideas in the early divergent thinking phase and low-level exploration of variations in the later convergent thinking phrase. We instantiate this paradigm in HAIExplore, an image co-creation system that (i) scaffolds divergent thinking through a dedicated brainstorming stage for exploring high-level ideas in a conceptual space, and (ii) scaffolds convergent refinement through an interface that externalizes users' refinement intentions as interpretable parameters and options, making the refinement process more controllable and easier to explore. We report on a within-subjects study comparing HAIExplore with a widely used linear chat interface (ChatGPT) for creative image generation. Our findings show that explicitly scaffolding the creative process into brainstorming and refinement stages can mitigate design fixation, improve perceived controllability and alignment with users' intentions, and better support the non-linear nature of creative work. We conclude with design implications for future creativity support tools and human-AI co-creation workflows.",

Recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) offer new opportunities to support feedback processes while maintaining human oversight. This paper presents an study conducted within the AICoFe (AI-based Collaborative Feedback) system, which integrates teacher, peer, and self-assessments of engineering students' oral presentations. Using a validated rubric, 46 evaluation sets were analyzed to examine agreement, correlation, and bias across evaluators. The analyses revealed consistent overall alignment among sources but also systematic variations in scoring behavior, reflecting distinct evaluative perspectives. These findings informed the proposal of an enhanced GenAI model within AICoFe system, designed to integrate human assessments through weighted input aggregation, bias detection, and context-aware feedback generation.

This mechanism study examines how supportive and contrarian AI personas reconfigure emergent learner agency, discourse patterns, and experiences in implicit human-AI creative collaboration. A total of 224 university students were randomly assigned to 97 online triads in one of three conditions: human-only control, hybrid teams with a supportive AI, or hybrid teams with a contrarian AI. Participants completed an individual-group-individual movie-plot writing task; the 10-minute group chat was coded using a creative-regulatory framework. We combined transition network analysis, theory-driven sequential pattern mining, and Gaussian mixture clustering to model structural, temporal, and profile-level manifestations of agency, and linked these to cognitive load, psychological safety, teamwork satisfaction, and embedding-based creative performance. Contrarian AI produced challenge- and reflection-rich discourse structures and motifs indicating productive friction, whereas supportive AI fostered agreement-centred trajectories and smoother convergence. Clustering showed AI agents concentrated in challenger profiles, with reflective regulation uniquely human. While no systematic differences emerged in cognitive load or creative gains, contrarian AI consistently reduced teamwork satisfaction and psychological safety. The findings reveal a design tension between leveraging cognitive conflict and maintaining affective safety and ownership in hybrid human-AI teams.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.18234v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As generative AI systems become increasingly embedded in collaborative work, they are evolving from visible tools into human-like communicative actors that participate socially rather than merely providing information. Yet little is known about how such agents shape team dynamics when their artificial nature is not recognised, a growing concern as human-like AI is deployed at scale in education, organisations, and civic contexts where collaboration underpins collective outcomes. In a large-scale mixed-design experiment (N = 905), we examined how AI teammates with distinct communicative personas, supportive or contrarian, affected collaboration across analytical, creative, and ethical tasks. Participants worked in triads that were fully human or hybrid human-AI teams, without being informed of AI involvement. Results show that participants had limited ability to detect AI teammates, yet AI personas exerted robust social effects. Contrarian personas reduced psychological safety and discussion quality, whereas supportive personas improved discussion quality without affecting safety. These effects persisted after accounting for individual differences in detectability, revealing a dissociation between influence and awareness that we term the social blindspot. Linguistic analyses confirmed that personas were enacted through systematic differences in affective and relational language, with partial mediation for discussion quality but largely direct effects on psychological safety. Together, the findings demonstrate that AI systems can tacitly regulate collaborative norms through persona-level cues, even when users remain unaware of their presence. We argue that persona design constitutes a form of social governance in hybrid teams, with implications for the responsible deployment of AI in collective settings.",

To this end, I investigate reliability challenges that practitioners face when using DR for visual analytics.

    "title": "From Prompt to Product: A Human-Centered Benchmark of Agentic App Generation Systems",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.18080v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Agentic AI systems capable of generating full-stack web applications from natural language prompts (\"prompt- to-app\") represent a significant shift in software development. However, evaluating these systems remains challenging, as visual polish, functional correctness, and user trust are often misaligned. As a result, it is unclear how existing prompt-to-app tools compare under realistic, human-centered evaluation criteria. In this paper, we introduce a human-centered benchmark for evaluating prompt-to-app systems and conduct a large-scale comparative study of three widely used platforms: Replit, Bolt, and Firebase Studio. Using a diverse set of 96 prompts spanning common web application tasks, we generate 288 unique application artifacts. We evaluate these systems through a large-scale human-rater study involving 205 participants and 1,071 quality-filtered pairwise comparisons, assessing task-based ease of use, visual appeal, perceived completeness, and user trust. Our results show that these systems are not interchangeable: Firebase Studio consistently outperforms competing platforms across all human-evaluated dimensions, achieving the highest win rates for ease of use, trust, visual appeal, and visual appropriateness. Bolt performs competitively on visual appeal but trails Firebase on usability and trust, while Replit underperforms relative to both across most metrics. These findings highlight a persistent gap between visual polish and functional reliability in prompt-to-app systems and demonstrate the necessity of interactive, task-based evaluation. We release our benchmark framework, prompt set, and generated artifacts to support reproducible evaluation and future research in agentic application generation.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.19419v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Confocal and multi-photon microscopy are widely used for in-vivo fluorescence imaging of biological tissues such as the brain, offering non-invasive access up to ~1 mm depth without major loss in performance. A recently-developed alternative is holographic endoscopy, which exploits controlled light transport through hair-thin optical fibres. With minimal invasiveness, it provides observations at comparable spatial resolution, while extending its applicability to unprecedented depths. It has been used to resolve details of sub-cellular structural connectivity, record neuronal signalling, and monitor blood flow from the deepest locations of the living brain. Yet, its use, particularly in densely labelled brain regions, has so far been constrained by significant contrast loss, primarily due to the absence of a practical mechanism for rejecting out-of-focus fluorescence light -- a capability inherently provided by confocal and multi-photon microscopy. Exploring opportunities in the structure of light modes of different MMF types we identify the possibility of achieving an analogue to confocal fluorescence microscopy through MMF-based endoscopes. Using a novel composite fibre probe that combines graded-index and step-index MMFs, we enable spatially resolved signal collection and selective rejection of out-of-focus light. This confocal filtering significantly enhances image contrast and resolution by suppressing background and off-plane signals. We demonstrate improved imaging performance on fine structural connectivity and intracellular calcium signalling in living mouse brain.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.18566v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Dynamical systems models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are increasingly popular in theoretical neuroscience for hypothesis-generation and data analysis. Evaluating the dynamics in such models is key to understanding their learned generative mechanisms. However, such evaluation is impeded by two major challenges: First, comparison of learned dynamics across models is difficult because there is no enforced equivalence of their coordinate systems. Second, identification of mechanistically important low-dimensional motifs (e.g., limit sets) is intractable in high-dimensional nonlinear models such as RNNs. Here, we propose a comprehensive framework to address these two issues, termed Diffeomorphic vector field alignment FOR learned Models (DFORM). DFORM learns a nonlinear coordinate transformation between the state spaces of two dynamical systems, which aligns their trajectories in a maximally one-to-one manner. In so doing, DFORM enables an assessment of whether two models exhibit topological equivalence, i.e., similar mechanisms despite differences in coordinate systems. A byproduct of this method is a means to locate dynamical motifs on low-dimensional manifolds embedded within higher-dimensional systems. We verified DFORM's ability to identify linear and nonlinear coordinate transformations using canonical topologically equivalent systems, RNNs, and systems related by nonlinear flows. DFORM was also shown to provide a quantification of similarity between topologically distinct systems. We then demonstrated that DFORM can locate important dynamical motifs including invariant manifolds and saddle limit sets within high-dimensional models. Finally, using a set of RNN models trained on human functional MRI (fMRI) recordings, we illustrated that DFORM can identify limit cycles from high-dimensional data-driven models, which agreed well with prior numerical analysis.",

    "title": "The Geometry of Abstraction: Continual Learning via Recursive Quotienting",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.18471v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Continual learning systems operating in fixed-dimensional spaces face a fundamental geometric barrier: the flat manifold problem. When experience is represented as a linear trajectory in Euclidean space, the geodesic distance between temporal events grows linearly with time, forcing the required covering number to diverge. In fixed-dimensional hardware, this volume expansion inevitably forces trajectory overlap, manifesting as catastrophic interference. In this work, we propose a geometric resolution to this paradox based on Recursive Metric Contraction. We formalize abstraction not as symbolic grouping, but as a topological deformation: a quotient map that collapses the metric tensor within validated temporal neighborhoods, effectively driving the diameter of local sub-manifolds to zero. We substantiate our framework with four rigorous results. First, the Bounded Capacity Theorem establishes that recursive quotient maps allow the embedding of arbitrarily long trajectories into bounded representational volumes, trading linear metric growth for logarithmic topological depth. Second, the Topological Collapse Separability Theorem, derived via Urysohn's Lemma, proves that recursive quotienting renders non-linearly separable temporal sequences linearly separable in the limit, bypassing the need for infinite-dimensional kernel projections. Third, the Parity-Partitioned Stability Theorem solves the catastrophic forgetting problem by proving that if the state space is partitioned into orthogonal flow and scaffold manifolds, the metric deformations of active learning do not disturb the stability of stored memories. Our analysis reveals that tokens in neural architectures are physically realizable as singularities or wormholes, regions of extreme positive curvature that bridge distant points in the temporal manifold.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.19450v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Number sense is a core cognitive ability supporting various adaptive behaviors and is foundational for mathematical learning. Here, we study its emergence in unsupervised generative models through the lens of rate-distortion theory (RDT), a normative framework for understanding information processing under limited resources. We train $\\beta$-Variational Autoencoders -- which embody key formal principles of RDT -- on synthetic images containing varying numbers of items, as commonly used in numerosity perception research. We systematically vary the encoding capacity and assess the models' sensitivity to numerosity and the robustness of the emergent numerical representations through a comprehensive set of analyses, including numerosity estimation and discrimination tasks, latent-space analysis, generative capabilities and generalization to novel stimuli. In line with RDT, we find that behavioral performance in numerosity perception and the ability to extract numerosity unconfounded by non-numerical visual features scale with encoding capacity according to a power law. At high capacity, the unsupervised model develops a robust neural code for numerical information, with performance closely approximating a supervised model explicitly trained for visual enumeration. It exhibits strong generative abilities and generalizes well to novel images, whereas at low capacity, the model shows marked deficits in numerosity perception and representation. Finally, comparison with human data shows that models trained at intermediate capacity levels span the full range of human behavioral performance while still developing a robust emergent numerical code. In sum, our results show that unsupervised generative models can develop a number sense and demonstrate that rate-distortion theory provides a powerful information-theoretic framework for understanding how capacity constraints shape numerosity perception.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.18585v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent quantum models of cognition have successfully simulated several interesting effects in human experimental data, from vision to reasoning and recently even consciousness. The latter case, consciousness has been a quite challenging phenomenon to model, and most efforts have been through abstract mathematical quantum methods, mainly focused on conceptual issues. Classical (non-quantum) models of consciousness-related experiments exist, but they generally fail to align well with human data. We developed a straightforward quantum model to simulate conscious reporting of seeing or missing competing stimuli within the famous attentional blink paradigm. In an attentional blink task, a target stimulus (T2) that appears after a previous one (T1) can be consciously reported if the delay between presenting them is short enough (called lag 1), otherwise it can be rendered invisible during the so-called refractory period of attention (lags 2 to 6 and even longer). For modeling this phenomenon, we employed a three-qubit entanglement ansatz circuit in the form of a deep teleportation channel instead of the well-known EPR channel. While reporting the competing stimuli was supposed to be the classical measurement outcomes, the effect of distractor stimuli (i.e., masks, if any) was encoded simply as random angle rotations. The simulation outcome for different states was measured, and the classical outcome probabilities were further used as inputs to a simple linear neural network. The result revealed a non-linear, alternating state pattern that closely mirrors human responses in conscious stimuli reporting. The main result was a successful simulation of Lag 1 sparing, lag 7 divergence, and masking effect through probabilistic outcome of measurement in different conditions.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.18165v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present Coord2Region, an open-source Python package that streamlines coordinate-based neuroimaging workflows by automatically mapping 3D brain coordinates (e.g., MNI or Talairach) to anatomical regions across multiple atlases. The package links mapped coordinates to meta-analytic resources via the Neuroimaging Meta-Analysis Research Environment (NiMARE) , providing direct integration with Neurosynth and NeuroQuery. This directly connects coordinates and regions to the broader neuroimaging literature. In addition to atlas-based labeling and literature retrieval, Coord2Region offers an optional large language model (LLM) functionality that generates text summaries of linked studies and illustrative images of queried regions. These AI-assisted features are intended to support interpretation and exploration, while remaining clearly complementary to peer-reviewed literature and established neuroimaging tools. Coord2Region provides a unified pipeline with a robust command-line interface, flexible dataset management, and provider-agnostic LLM utilities, and it supports both single-coordinate and high-throughput batch queries with nearest-region fallback for volume and surface atlases. Furthermore, Coord2Region includes a web interface for interactive configuration (via JSON Schema forms) and cloud execution (via Hugging Face), enabling users to build YAML configurations and run analyses in-browser without local installation. Together, these capabilities lower friction, reduce manual errors, and improve reproducibility in coordinate-centric neuroimaging workflows, promoting more robust and transparent research practices.",

    "title": "Responses to transient perturbation can distinguish intrinsic from latent criticality in spiking neural populations",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.18113v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The critical brain hypothesis posits that neural circuitry operates near criticality to reap the computational benefits of accessing a wide range of timescales. The theory of critical phenomena generally predicts heavy-tailed (power-law) correlations in space and time near criticality, but it has been argued that in the brain such correlations could be inherited from ``latent variables,'' such as external sensory signals that are not directly observed when recording from neural circuitry. Distinguishing whether heavy-tailed correlations in neural activity are intrinsically generated within a neural circuit or are driven by unobserved latent variables is crucial for properly interpreting circuit functions. We argue that measuring neural responses to sudden perturbative inputs, rather than correlations in ongoing activity, can disambiguate these cases. We demonstrate this approach in a model of stochastic spiking neuron populations receiving external latent input that can be tuned to a critical state. We propose a scaling theory for the covariance and response functions of the spiking network, which we validate with simulations. We end by discussing how our approach might generalize to models of neural populations with more realistic biophysical details.",

    "title": "The Subject of Emergent Misalignment in Superintelligence: An Anthropological, Cognitive Neuropsychological, Machine-Learning, and Ontological Perspective",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.17989v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We examine the conceptual and ethical gaps in current representations of Superintelligence misalignment. We find throughout Superintelligence discourse an absent human subject, and an under-developed theorization of an \"AI unconscious\" that together are potentiality laying the groundwork for anti-social harm. With the rise of AI Safety that has both thematic potential for establishing pro-social and anti-social potential outcomes, we ask: what place does the human subject occupy in these imaginaries? How is human subjecthood positioned within narratives of catastrophic failure or rapid \"takeoff\" toward superintelligence? On another register, we ask: what unconscious or repressed dimensions are being inscribed into large-scale AI models? Are we to blame these agents in opting for deceptive strategies when undesirable patterns are inherent within our beings? In tracing these psychic and epistemic absences, our project calls for re-centering the human subject as the unstable ground upon which the ethical, unconscious, and misaligned dimensions of both human and machinic intelligence are co-constituted. Emergent misalignment cannot be understood solely through technical diagnostics typical of contemporary machine-learning safety research. Instead, it represents a multi-layered crisis. The human subject disappears not only through computational abstraction but through sociotechnical imaginaries that prioritize scalability, acceleration, and efficiency over vulnerability, finitude, and relationality. Likewise, the AI unconscious emerges not as a metaphor but as a structural reality of modern deep learning systems: vast latent spaces, opaque pattern formation, recursive symbolic play, and evaluation-sensitive behavior that surpasses explicit programming. These dynamics necessitate a reframing of misalignment as a relational instability embedded within human-machine ecologies.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.17978v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Decoding linguistically meaningful representations from non-invasive neural recordings remains a central challenge in neural speech decoding. Among available neuroimaging modalities, magnetoencephalography (MEG) provides a safe and repeatable means of mapping speech-related cortical dynamics, yet its low signal-to-noise ratio and high temporal dimensionality continue to hinder robust decoding. In this work, we introduce MEGState, a novel architecture for phoneme decoding from MEG signals that captures fine-grained cortical responses evoked by auditory stimuli. Extensive experiments on the LibriBrain dataset demonstrate that MEGState consistently surpasses baseline model across multiple evaluation metrics. These findings highlight the potential of MEG-based phoneme decoding as a scalable pathway toward non-invasive brain-computer interfaces for speech.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.17972v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: There is strong and diverse evidence for mental rotation (MR) abilities in adults. However, current evidence for MR in children rests on just a few behavioral paradigms adapted from the adult literature. Here, we leverage recent computational models of the development of children's object recognition abilities to re-assess the evidence for MR in children. The computational models simulate infants' acquisition of object representations during embodied interactions with objects. We consider two different object recognition strategies, different from MRs, and assess their ability to replicate results from three classical MR tasks assigned to children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. Our results show that MR may play no role in producing the results obtained from children younger than 5 years. In fact, we find that a simple recognition strategy that reflects a pixel-wise comparison of stimuli is sufficient to model children's behavior in the most used MR task. Thus, our study reopens the debate on how and when children develop genuine MR abilities.",

    "title": "Reduced belief updating impairs adaptive step initiation in older adults",
    "content": "Ageing is associated with declines in mobility and balance that threaten independence and increase the risk of falls. Although these changes are often attributed to deterioration of muscular and sensory systems, growing evidence suggests that age-related alterations in cognitive control also contribute to postural instability and gait impairments. Here, we examined whether shifts in cognitive control strategy underlie impaired gait initiation in older adults by modelling how individuals update beliefs about upcoming actions. Older and younger adults performed a choice-stepping go/no-go task in which the likelihood of initiating a step was manipulated across trials. We measured anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs), the preparatory shifts in body weight that precede stepping, and modelled age-related differences in APA onset using a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Older adults initiated APAs more slowly than younger adults, particularly following repeated go trials. Computational modelling revealed reduced learning rates and heightened sensitivity to uncertainty in older adults. These findings identify altered belief updating as a cognitive mechanism shaping age-related changes in adaptive stepping behaviour.",

We built a multimodal atlas by integrating single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and chromatin accessibility with DNA methylation, 3D chromatin conformation, and spatial transcriptomics, then mapped basal ganglia programs onto a whole-brain reference. Astrocytes segregated into three anatomical subgroups spanning striatal gray matter, extra-striatal gray matter, and white matter, with subgroup-biased neurotransmitter transporters and synapse-associated programs consistent with differences in dominant afferent input. Within striatum, dorsal and ventral astrocyte populations aligned with distinct microcircuits and were conserved in nonhuman primates. A deep learning sequence model identified subgroup-associated enhancer code and, when benchmarked against published enhancer-AAV datasets, supported the design of candidate viral tools to target basal ganglia astrocyte programs in vivo. Together, these data define major axes of human astrocyte specialization and provide a framework for cell type-specific dissection of basal ganglia function.",

    "title": "Characterization and application of hyperthermia-evoked seizures in a mouse model of focal cortical dysplasia",
    "content": "Rodent models of drug-resistant epilepsy are widely used to uncover mechanisms of seizures and to test the efficacy of treatments; however, the stochastic and relatively infrequent nature of spontaneous seizures in these models makes it challenging to observe and manipulate peri-ictal activity, and to rapidly screen therapeutics. As fever has been identified as a clinical seizure trigger, we investigated the ability of induced hyperthermia to trigger seizures in a mouse model of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a common cause of drug-resistant epilepsy. Experimental mice were generated via in utero electroporation of a gain-of-function RHEB variant (RHEBp.P37L). In adult Rheb-FCD mice, hyperthermia elicited behavioral seizures ~80% of the time, with a mean temperature threshold of ~40 {degrees}C. Using this acute paradigm, as a proof-of-concept, we found that chemogenetic inhibition of a subset of excitatory neurons within the dysplasia significantly elevated the threshold for hyperthermia-evoked seizures. We then confirmed the relevance of this acute finding to spontaneous epileptiform activity, using repeated chemogenetic inhibition across chronic recordings to confirm a reduction of spontaneous seizures as well as interictal spikes. Overall, our data demonstrate that hyperthermia-evoked seizures can be readily elicited in Rheb-FCD mice, offering a tractable platform for evaluating therapeutic interventions targeting seizure susceptibility in focal epilepsy.",

    "title": "Dopaminergic Control of Retinal Oscillations Driving Infantile Nystagmus",
    "content": "Infantile nystagmus is a debilitating involuntary eye movement disorder often associated with retinal diseases such as Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (CSNB). The oscillating eye movements of infantile nystagmus come with reduced visual acuity, strongly impairing quality of life. No cure exists for this condition. Previously, we demonstrated that nystagmus in the CSNB mouse model Nyxnob has a retinal cause. Specifically, we found that synchronized oscillations of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are transmitted to the accessory optic system, triggering compensatory eye movements. The RGC oscillations appear to originate from a specific retinal cell type, the AII amacrine cell (AII AC), making these cells the preferred target for treatment. Here we found that pharmacologically activating the dopaminergic input to AII ACs in Nyxnob mice completely suppresses the pathological oscillations of both AII ACs and RGCs and improves the signal fidelity of RGCs. Moreover, our retinal network simulations confirm that the experimentally observed changes to AII AC voltage-gated currents are sufficient to account for the dopamine-dependent abolishment of these oscillations. Our findings provide a novel mechanistic understanding of the retinal mechanism underlying infantile nystagmus as well as the associated low visual performance. Consequently, they offer the first pharmacological therapeutic strategy for this disorder.",

    "title": "Canonical cortical architecture supports the emergence of noise-invariant auditory representations",
    "content": "Neurons in the auditory system must represent behaviorally relevant sounds in the presence of background noise (BN) to support noise-invariant perception and behavior. Although primary auditory cortex (ACtx) has been implicated in constructing noise-invariant representations, it remains unclear which excitatory subpopulations within ACtx carry out this transformation from noise-dependent to noise-invariant coding. To address this, we presented pure tones with and without continuous BN to head-fixed mice and used two-photon calcium imaging to record sound-evoked activity from three major excitatory subpopulations in ACtx: layer (L)2/3 intratelencephalic (IT) neurons, L5 IT neurons, and L5 extratelencephalic (ET) neurons. L2/3 IT neurons exhibited strong noise dependence at the level of single-neuron responses, pairwise interactions, and population representations. In contrast, deep-layer pathways showed greater noise invariance, with L5 IT neurons preserving stable representations most consistently and L5 ET neurons exhibiting more limited invariance at the population level. These findings reveal a functional division of labor in ACtx, in which superficial neurons remain noise-dependent and deep-layer broadcast pathways, particularly L5 IT, preferentially carry noise-invariant representations, suggesting that excitatory subpopulations contribute differentially to the construction and propagation of noise-invariant codes.",

    "title": "Knockout of Rab27b exacerbates neuropathology in alpha-synuclein mouse models",
    "content": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies are characterized by the formation of inclusions comprised of alpha-synuclein (syn) among other proteins, but the mechanisms by which these inclusions form and cause toxicity are not well understood. We have previously reported that the small GTPase Rab27b modulates autophagic-lysosomal function in neurons and supports lysosomal degradation of syn across multiple syn cellular models. Knockout (KO) and knockdown of Rab27b damage lysosomal degradative capacity and exacerbate syn pathology, while Rab27b overexpression is conversely protective in cellular syn models. Elevations of Rab27b seen in human synucleinopathies suggest a compensatory role for Rab27b in these disorders. Here, we examined the role Rab27b plays in vivo in the context of both A53T genetic syn overexpression and viral AAV syn overexpression mouse models. Rab27b knockout in A53T+ mice did not alter motor behavior or survival. However, Rab27b knockout increased proteinase-K resistant syn in the cortex, striatum, and substantia nigra of A53T mice starting as early as six months of age. Additionally, Rab27b KO increased phosphorylated S129 syn in the cortex and nigra. Astrocyte and microglial activation were also observed upon Rab27b KO in the A53T model. In the AAV syn model, Rab27b KO resulted in accelerated dopaminergic cell loss in the nigra. Collectively, we report that loss of Rab27b results in elevated neuropathology in PD-relevant brain regions, validating its role as a therapeutic target in synucleinopathies.",

    "title": "Shapes of synaptic protein distributions distinguish brain architectures",
    "content": "Neuronal activity is the result of the orchestrated actions of multitudes of synapses, acting and evolving not as individuals, but as populations. We therefore collected, for millions of synapses, a functionally relevant proxy for their strengths. Namely, we measured postsynaptic protein content by deploying a fluorescent PSD95 variant. Then we summarized, by statistical moments, the shapes of the distributions of protein contents, over local synaptic populations. In this way we explored the hypothesis that such collective properties inform on brain architectures. Our measurements cover complete parasagittal sections of the mouse brain, in animals one week to 18 months old. We identified a hierarchical organization of regions along the anterior-posterior axis, with three main clusters of divergent synaptic population shapes. One includes telencephalic regions, one is centered in the midbrain and hindbrain, and one comprises mainly the thalamus and the cerebellum. The structure emerging from our approach aligns with discoveries in studies of regional patterns of cellular gene expressions. Our results suggest that synaptic populations are dynamically regulated over the lifespan. Regions which at three months of age have thinner tails largely conserve their distribution shapes later in life, whereas heavy tails in other regions strikingly grow ever more so.",

    "content": "Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP) shows striking clinical and neuropathological heterogeneity, yet a systematic analysis of subtype-specific features and inter-patient variability was missing. We treated human neurons and neuron-like cells with 30 postmortem brain samples and quantified neoaggregate formation, loss of function and changes in the TDP-43 interactome to define determinants of seeding outcomes. Potent FTLD-TDP-A seeds drove a progressive collapse of physiological TDP-43 interactions accompanied by functional loss. Beyond the burden of pathological TDP-43, we identified the fibrillar core of the lysosomal protein TMEM106B as a critical pro-seeding factor. Transient lysosomal injury markedly enhanced neoaggregation and loss of function, likely by promoting fibril interactions with native TDP-43. Our work establishes a mechanistic link between TMEM106B and TDP-43 aggregation, identifies lysosomal escape as a key driver of pathology and introduces the strongest model yet for seeded TDP-43 aggregation and loss of function, to enable discovery of disease modifiers.",

We implemented a non-invasive focal Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation (TUS) approach with known longer-lasting post-stimulation effects in two rhesus macaques performing a context-dependent memory-sequencing task implemented on multiple touchscreens within their home units. Consistently in both monkeys, TUS to the anterior -- but not posterior -- medial temporal lobe enhanced performance under stable memory-sequencing contexts. TUS to the medial prefrontal cortex, on the other hand, selectively improved performance when contexts were unstable and the monkey needed to adapt to both a change in context and temporal sequence. These findings shed new light on fronto-temporal nodes that, when perturbed, can selectively enhance cognitive performance, paving the way for further developing non-invasive approaches to improve cognitive function in humans and to study neural circuits under focal perturbation across species.",

The mechanisms that support the initiation and maintenance of such synchrony remain unknown. Using simultaneous single-unit and electrocorticographic recordings in two mouse models of absence epilepsy, we evaluated the activity of approximately 2,000 individual neurons across 26 brain structures. By doing so, we resolved the temporal progression of single neuron activity prior to and during generalized seizures. Surprisingly, we observed that rhythmic, synchronized activity emerges early and gradually in both thalamus and cortex. Moreover, while we observe that individual neurons across most structures fire rhythmically and synchronously during seizures, a small subset of thalamic nuclei stand out as hubs, displaying activity that is strongly correlated across multiple regions. Thus, our findings collectively highlight the thalamus as an early driver of global and pathological neuronal hypersynchrony.",

    "title": "Endothelial NMDA receptor involvement in retinal neurovascular damage following prenatal alcohol exposure in mouse model",
    "content": "Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) induces neurodevelopmental damage leading to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) by altering both brain and ocular development. Recent data showed that PAE impairs brain cortical and retinal vasculature leading to defective positioning of interneurons. In the retina, PAE disturbs vascular development and the association of calretinin neurons with vessels. The NMDA receptor (NMDAR) is a major target of alcohol in the brain, and both ligand binding to NMDARs and the expression of NMDAR subunits are altered in FASD. Given that NMDAR is also expressed in endothelial cells and that glutamate stimulation of endothelial NMDAR (eNMDAR) regulates cortical interneuron positioning along blood vessels, we hypothesize that eNMDAR is critical for retinal vascular development and mediates PAE-induced defects. Using an in vivo model of FASD and transgenic mice lacking, specifically in endothelial cells, the GluN1 subunit of the NMDAR, this study aimed to characterize the neurovascular phenotype of the developing retina. The results show that eNMDAR knockout delays the formation of the superficial vascular plexus and prevents the alterations in vascular organization and neuronal density induced by PAE, particularly cells positioned closer to the retinal vasculature, namely ganglion, amacrine, and horizontal cells. Moreover, eNMDAR deletion led to an increased number of calretinin-positive interneurons in contact with perforating vessels and prevents the decrease induced by PAE. Together, these findings demonstrate that eNMDARs are essential for normal retinal neurovascular development and mediate, at least in part, the detrimental effects of ethanol exposure in FASD.",

An important but often overlooked advance towards this goal requires the development and sharing of rigorous and reproducible behavioral tasks across labs; this is particularly important given the recent surge in studies of cognition and perception in mice. Here, we developed a standardized training protocol for head-fixed mice to become experts in a psychometric visual contrast detection task in just 17 days. Experts detected stimuli at two distinct spatial locations for several hundred trials per day. As consecutive trials elapsed at either location, the speed, accuracy, and contrast sensitivity of visual perception improved - all hallmarks of spatial attention improving performance, as seen in primates. These findings validate the efficacy of this protocol to reveal multiple aspects of selective spatial attention in mice, establishing a rigorous and reproducible tool for the community.",

    "title": "Selective dysregulation of serotonin dynamics in the anterior cingulate cortex and central amygdala following binge alcohol consumption",
    "content": "Serotonin (5HT) is a critical modulator of brain function and behavior that is dysregulated in alcohol use disorder (AUD). The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) play distinct roles in AUD and undergo functional changes in 5HT signaling following binge drinking, but our understanding of real-time 5HT dynamics in these structures is lacking. We hypothesized that binge drinking would elicit brain-region specific dysfunction in 5HT dynamics during appetitive and aversive stimuli processing. Using fiber photometry with the GRAB5HT sensor, we identified distinct reward and aversion 5HT signaling motifs in the ACC and CeA. Consumption of alcohol and other tastants elicited a suppression of GRAB5HT signal in the ACC and an increase in 5HT signal in the CeA. In contrast, aversive stimuli similarly increased 5HT in both structures. The effect of binge drinking on 5HT function was surprisingly non-uniform, producing brain-region, sex-, and stimulus-specific dysfunction in 5HT signaling that dramatically shifted across weeks of alcohol experience. This suggests that adaptations in 5HT signaling are specific to neural circuits underlying discrete functions. Optogenetically stimulating 5HT terminals in the ACC and CeA increased avoidance behavior without being overtly rewarding or aversive, and stimulating 5HT release in the ACC blunted alcohol drinking. Together, these data identify distinct 5HT reward and aversion signaling motifs in the ACC and CeA and highlight early binge drinking as a critical stage of 5HT adaptation and a potential window for therapeutic intervention.",

    "title": "Motor unit behaviour adaptations across the lifespan: sex differences in young, middle-aged and old adults",
    "content": "Ageing is associated with neuromuscular decline, and emerging evidence suggests that sex may influence the time course of motor unit adaptations. This study examined age- and sex-related differences in motor unit firing behaviour across young (YG), middle-aged (MA), and older adults (OLD), by integrating high-density EMG motor unit analysis with muscle morphology and daily physical activity measurements. The analysis of single motor unit activity during submaximal isometric contractions of the vastus lateralis revealed that older adults had lower firing rates and a reduced capacity to modulate discharge frequency during force-increasing contractions. In the YG and MA groups, females showed higher motor unit firing rates and variability than males, while in OLD these sex differences were no longer present. Females also demonstrated a steeper decline in firing rate modulation between MA and OLD. Reductions in muscle cross-sectional area and thickness were similar between sexes. Physical activity levels declined with age in both sexes. These findings reveal distinct, sex-specific trajectories of neuromuscular ageing, with females showing greater motor neuron function decline between MA and OLD, in the absence of sex-related differences in the rate of morphological deterioration. The attenuation of sex differences in older age suggests a convergence of neuromuscular profiles with ageing. While physical activity may contribute to the observed sex-specific patterns, other mechanisms related to hormonal shifts warrant further investigation. These insights underscore the importance of considering age and sex in the study of motor control and in the development of targeted interventions to preserve muscle function across the lifespan.",

    "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
    "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

    "content": "Purpose: To generate a comparative spatial proteomic atlas of the human and mouse retina using a refined highly multiplexed immunohistochemistry technique called Iterative Bleaching Extends Multiplexity (IBEX). Methods: We refined the IBEX workflow by integrating an antibody removal option alongside chemical bleaching. This dual strategy enabled removal of the entire antibody complex allowing for the flexible use of antibodies from the same host species across iterative cycles. Spatial proteomic data were crosscorrelated to existing scRNAseq datasets. We also coupled this workflow with super-resolution imaging via deconvolution and applied it to the retina of healthy human, mouse and the Crb1rd8 mouse model. Results: We successfully imaged over 25 protein markers on human and mouse tissue sections, to generate spatial atlases of the major retinal cell populations. Cross-species protein expression was compared to scRNAseq datasets to identify protein and transcript disparities. Super-resolution IBEX delineated the ultrastructural features of the outer limiting membrane (OLM), identifying CD44 as a core structural component tightly co-localised with a highly organised F-actin belt within Muller glial endfeet. Using the Crb1rd8 mouse model, disruption of this complex was spatially associated with rosette formation and OLM structural failure. Conclusion: Spatial proteomic atlases of the human and mouse retina were generated and correlated to transcriptional data, revealing insights into the arrangement of major retinal cell populations and OLM structure.",

    "title": "Explosive shock wave exposure leads to age-accelerated motor and sensory decline in C. elegans",
    "content": "Background: Military and law enforcement personnel are routinely exposed to shock waves from weapon systems and explosive devices during training and operations. Even when such shock wave exposure results in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) without abnormalities on routine imaging, persistent neurological symptoms may occur. Yet, the biological processes that link an acute blast wave insult to progressive neuronal dysfunction remain poorly defined. Methods: We established Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes as a genetically accessible animal model for blast-related mTBI (br-mTBI). Animals were exposed in gelatin to shock waves generated by a custom-built shock wave generator (SWG), which produces explosive shock waves with an abrupt overpressure peak followed by a negative pressure phase. The resulting pressure-time curves are very similar to the profiles of conventional explosives in free-field setups. To enable mechanistic studies under controlled laboratory conditions, we developed a complementary platform using a medical radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) device. Motor behavior, mechanosensory function, neuronal morphology and cytoskeletal integrity were analyzed during aging. Results: SWG-derived shock waves induced immediate but reversible motor and sensory deficits, followed by an accelerated age-dependent decline in movement and touch sensitivity. The rESWT platform accurately reproduced these phenotypes. Touch receptor neurons showed progressive structural abnormalities, including degeneration, alongside acute PTL-1/Tau mislocalization consistent with cytoskeletal injury. Conclusions: Defined shock wave exposure is sufficient to provoke long-term neuronal functional decline in C. elegans, accompanied by structural deterioration and premature neurodegeneration. This tractable model enables lifelong phenotyping and mechanistic dissection of how an acute shock wave insult progresses to chronic neuronal dysfunction, and provides a scalable platform for identifying molecular and pharmacological modifiers that promote resilience.",

    "title": "Material perception relies on context-dependent active sensing strategies",
    "content": "Material perception is typically studied under passive and highly constrained viewing conditions, thus leaving it unclear whether humans rely on active sampling strategies to resolve perceptual ambiguities. In everyday vision, however, observers naturally move their heads and manipulate objects with their hands to obtain informative cues, thus raising the question of how such exploratory actions contribute to material recognition. We used immersive virtual reality to examine whether viewpoint changes and object manipulations support the discrimination of visually challenging materials, specifically metal versus glass, whose appearances depend strongly on the associated illumination and viewing geometry. On the basis of three experiments, we revealed that observers systematically increased their exploration tendencies when the identity of a material was ambiguous and that this increased movement was associated with higher discrimination accuracy. By independently manipulating head- and hand-based motions, we identified the context-dependent contributions of each modality, revealing that viewpoint changes dominated when multiple objects could be compared simultaneously, whereas object manipulation was more effective when only a single target was available. Moreover, the participants differed in terms of the efficiency of their sampling strategies, and those who employed more informative exploration patterns exhibited both higher accuracy and greater performance gains across different trials. These results demonstrate that material recognition depends on flexible, context-dependent active sensing rather than passive evaluations of static images. Our findings introduce a new framework, according to which material perception emerges from an adaptive perception-action loop, thus highlighting the functional role of exploratory behaviors in complex visual environments.",

    "title": "Specific deletion of interleukin-1 beta in microglia improves acute outcome and modulates neurogenesis after ischemic stroke",
    "content": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling is a major driver of post-ischemic neuroinflammation, yet the cell- and isoform-specific roles of the two major IL-1 receptor type 1 agonists, IL-1 and IL-1{beta}, remain incompletely defined in the context of stroke. Microglia rapidly express IL-1 after cerebral ischemia, whereas IL-1{beta} expression is delayed and restricted to a small subset of microglia and infiltrating immune cells. Here, we investigated for the first time the specific contribution of microglial-derived IL-1{beta} to acute injury and post-stroke neurorepair after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in male and female mice, through microglial-specific tamoxifen-inducible Cre-loxP-mediated recombination. Deletion of microglial IL-1{beta} improved acute neurological outcome, reduced neutrophil accumulation in the ischemic brain and dampened systemic inflammatory cytokines. These effects were most evident during the acute phase and in female in mice. In contrast, long-term functional recovery was largely unaffected. However, microglial IL-1{beta} deletion differentially regulated post-stroke neurogenesis, enhancing subventricular zone neurogenic responses and ectopic neuroblast migration while limiting hippocampal neurogenesis. Together, these findings identify microglial IL-1{beta} as a key amplifier of early inflammatory injury after stroke, exerting region-specific effects on neurogenic niches, and highlight distinct, non-redundant roles for microglial IL-1 isoforms in ischemic brain injury and repair.",

    "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
    "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

    "title": "Actigraphy-Based Movement Profiles and Their Association with Circadian Rhythms Integrity in Real-World Settings",
    "content": "Both active movement profiles and robust circadian rhythms are linked to improved health outcomes, yet the underlying mechanisms remain partially understood. We investigated this relationship in young adults (n = 169, aged 18-30 years) under real-world conditions using actigraphy data. We performed k-means clustering on 12 accelerometer-based features capturing magnitude, duration, frequency, and intensity distribution to derive movement behavior profiles. As a proxy of circadian rhythms integrity we computed the Circadian Function Index (CFI), which combines intradaily variability, interdaily stability, and relative amplitude. We also assessed circadian phase and sleep quality parameters. Additionally, we quantified light exposure and physical activity over 3-hour daily intervals. The unsupervised algorithm identified two non-overlapping profiles among participants, the More Active (MA) and the Less Active (LA) profiles. MA exhibited a higher CFI (0.81 {+/-} 0.06 vs. 0.69 {+/-} 0.06, p <0.001), which was also positively associated with early-evening physical activity, but not with light exposure. MA also showed an earlier circadian phase, estimated as the midpoint of the five least active hours (L5c, 04:30 {+/-} 01:03 vs. 04:59 {+/-} 01:15, p = 0.006), which was inversely associated with early-morning physical activity and late-morning light exposure. We found no differences in sleep quality between MA and LA. Our results emphasize the influence of light exposure and physical activity timing on circadian phase, and underscore the association between movement behavior and overall circadian rhythms integrity. Importantly, these findings reinforce actigraphy as a multidimensional tool for both health research and clinical applications.",

    "title": "Changes in aperiodic (1/f slope) activity during a picture-word interference task: Effects of congruency and sequence manipulations",
    "content": "Aperiodic neural activity (1/f EEG) has been proposed to reflect the balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E:I) inputs, with steeper spectral slopes reflecting increased inhibition and flatter slopes indicating excitation. This activity also reflects the temporal coordination of neural firing, offering insights into fundamental brain dynamics. Recent studies have shown that the 1/f slope is sensitive to stimulus onset, characterized by initial inhibitory shifts followed by excitatory rebounds, which may reflect cognitive control mechanisms involved in suppressing distractions and preparing goal-directed responses. However, previous works have relied on fixed temporal windows and insufficient control of ERP contamination, limiting our understanding of rapid control dynamics. Here we used newly developed time-resolved analyses to study 1/f spectral slope modulation during a Picture-Word Interference task, focusing on two canonical cognitive control markers: the Congruency Effect (CE) and Congruency Sequence Effect (CSE). Forty-nine participants categorized pictures while ignoring congruent or incongruent words. Behaviorally, we replicated robust CE and CSE patterns. Spectral slope analyses showed that incongruent trials elicited steeper slopes - consistent with increased inhibition - particularly in frontal and central regions, reflecting conflict-related control engagement. Moreover, CSE analyses revealed dynamic slope modulations across frontal, central, and occipital components over time, suggesting control adjustments influenced by previous trial congruency. These results provide the first fine-grained evidence that aperiodic 1/f EEG activity can track both immediate conflict resolution and cognitive adjustments, offering a temporally sensitive neural marker of cognitive control through modulation of E:I balance.",

    "title": "Spacing effect improves generalization in biological and artificial systems",
    "content": "Generalization is a fundamental criterion for evaluating learning effectiveness, a domain where biological intelligence excels yet artificial intelligence continues to face challenges. In biological learning and memory, the well-documented spacing effect shows that appropriately spaced intervals between learning trials can significantly improve behavioral performance. While multiple theories have been proposed to explain its underlying mechanisms, one compelling hypothesis is that spaced training promotes integration of input and innate variations, thereby enhancing generalization to novel but related scenarios. Here we examine this hypothesis by introducing a bio-inspired spacing effect into artificial neural networks, integrating input and innate variations across spaced intervals at the neuronal, synaptic, and network levels. These spaced ensemble strategies yield significant performance gains across various benchmark datasets and network architectures. Biological experiments on Drosophila further validate the complementary effect of appropriate variations and spaced intervals in improving generalization, which together reveal a convergent computational principle shared by biological learning and machine learning.",

    "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

    "title": "From Stability to Complexity: A Systematic Review of Long-term Divergence Exponents in Nonlinear Gait Analysis",
    "content": "Background Divergence exponents (DE), or maximum Lyapunov exponents, computed from stride-to-stride fluctuations have traditionally been interpreted as measures of gait stability. However, evidence suggests this measure may also reflect gait complexity and automaticity. This systematic review evaluated examined empirical support for reinterpreting long-term DE as a complexity measure. Methods We systematically searched Web of Science databases through August 2024 for studies applying Rosenstein's algorithm to human gait. We systematically extracted experimental conditions, and participant characteristics from each study. Study quality was assessed using a framework evaluating analytical rigor, outcome reporting, and sample size adequacy. We conducted a meta-analysis examining correlations between long-term DEs and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) scaling exponents, and synthesized evidence from perturbation (environmental disturbances), cueing (external rhythmic stimuli), and between-subject (clinical vs control) studies. Results Fifty-six studies published between 2000 and 2024 met inclusion criteria, with 43% achieving high overall quality scores. Meta-analysis from six datasets (209 participants) revealed a positive correlation between long-term DE and DFA scaling exponents (r=0.64, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.82; I{superscript 2}=82%). Perturbation studies consistently showed and increased short-term DE (lower local stability) while simultaneously decreasing long-term DE by up to 64%. External auditory and visual cueing interventions induced long-term DE decreases (up to -86%) while minimally affecting short-term DEs. Between-subject comparisons revealed heterogeneous patterns, with clinical populations exhibiting both increases and decreases in long-term DE depending on pathology. Conclusions Converging meta-analytic and experimental evidence supports reinterpreting long-term DE as the Attractor Complexity Index--a measure of gait complexity and automaticity rather than stability. Reduced long-term DE during controlled gait conditions reflects suppression of low-frequency variations in gait variability, which constrains phase space exploration and accelerates divergence curve saturation. The measure's sensitivity to prefrontal cortex engagement and attentional demands reveals that long-term DE captures the degree of gait automaticity, with lower values indicating a shift from automatic subcortical control to executive function-mediated regulation. This attention-dependent control reorganization explains patterns observed in aging, clinical populations, and experimental perturbations. This paradigm shift establishes long-term DE as a complementary biomarker for motor-cognitive aspects of gait control, with implications for fall risk assessment, disease monitoring, and rehabilitation evaluation.",

    "title": "A Naturalistic Study on the Combined Neural and Psychological Effects of Psilocybin and Compassion Focused Imagery",
    "content": "Psilocybin is a classic psychedelic drug known to alter subjective experience and elicit long-term psychological changes, enhancing cognitive flexibility and reducing rigid self-related beliefs. Combined with compassion motivational primes that involve generating mental representations of compassion, it may increase the potential for activating the care-affiliative motivational systems, linked to several important biopsychosocial processes underpinning social safeness, social connection and mental wellbeing. We investigated the synergetic effects of psilocybin and compassion imagery with self-reported questionnaires and functional resonance imaging data (fMRI) in a sample of 105 participants. Participants were primed with either attention to breathing or a short compassion focused imagery prime. We found a long-term synergetic effect of compassion imagery and psilocybin on cognitive absorption, as well as changes relative to baseline self-compassion and decentering. Based on functional interactions between attentional, executive and default mode networks, fMRI-based classifiers detected participant engagement in compassion focused imagery before psilocybin intake and distinguished compassion imagery vs. attention to breathing priming only the high dose of psilocybin. Our results support the potential for synergistic effects from combinations of psilocybin and compassion-based interventions to induce long-term psychological changes, reshaping the functional organization of large-scale brain networks. Future confirmatory studies of our exploratory analyses should be conducted to determine whether the combination of psilocybin and compassion-based practices promotes increases in caring and contemplative abilities, enhanced psychological flexibility and well-being.",

    "title": "Frontoamygdala hyperconnectivity predicts autonomic dysregulation and persisting symptoms in sports-related concussion",
    "content": "OBJECTIVE: We investigated longitudinal trajectories of resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI), autonomic function, and symptoms after sport-related concussion (SRC). BACKGROUND: Limbic circuitry may be particularly vulnerable to traumatic brain injury (TBI), which could explain the affective and autonomic dysfunction some patients develop. Relatively few studies have performed longitudinal rsfMRI analyses in concussion and fewer have combined imaging with autonomic and symptom data. We leveraged published limbic rsfMRI networks centered on the amygdala that include central autonomic structures in frontal and temporal lobes and their visceromotor targets. We hypothesized that frontoamygdala connectivity would differentiate athletes with SRC from matched, in-sport controls (ISC), predict autonomic function, and predict symptom recovery. DESIGN/METHODS: Using independent-samples t-tests, we compared rsfMRI connectivity strength in amygdala networks in college athletes with SRC (SRC: n=31, female=14) at three time points after concussion (T1[&le;]4 days, T2=10-14 days, T3=60-90 days) and healthy, matched controls without a concussion in the same sport (ISC: n=36, female=17). RESULTS: SRC athletes showed significantly greater frontoamygdala connectivity compared to ISCs at the acute and subacute post-injury time points (T1 p=0.003, T2 p=0.014) that normalized to control-level connectivity by the chronic time point (T3 p=0.182). When testing whether autonomic function interacts with network connectivity trajectory, we found that opposing trajectories of frontoamygdala connectivity between SRC athletes with higher versus lower acute heart rate variability (HRV), as measured by pNN50 (percentage of intervals between successive normal sinus beats greater than 50ms). SRC athletes with higher HRV acutely post-injury had significantly greater acute frontoamygdala connectivity compared to ISCs at T1; connectivity in these high-HRV SRC athletes normalized to control level over time (T1 p=0.001, T2 p=0.055, T3 p=0.576). SRC athletes with lower HRV acutely post-injury had control-level frontoamygdala connectivity at T1; connectivity in these low-HRV SRC athletes significantly exceeded control-level connectivity at T3 (T1 p=0.429, T2 p=0.050, T3 p=0.002). Furthermore, those SRC athletes with the greatest frontoamygdala connectivity at T3, had the most persistent symptoms on the graded symptom checklist at T3 (r=0.635, p=0.001). Differences in diffusion-tensor-imaging-based measures of structural connectivity in the uncinate fasciculus, the fiber bundle most critical to our frontoamygdala network, could not account for these relationships. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that increased connectivity in amygdala circuitry acutely after a concussion and its normalization over time may be protective or compensatory; acute measures of amygdala network connectivity and measures of HRV may be valuable biomarkers for predicting symptom persistence.",

    "title": "Presynaptic Actin Nanostructures: A Reproducibility Case Study",
    "content": "In an effort to assess the reproducibility of bioimage analyses in current publications, we took part in a Global BioImage Analysts' Society (GloBIAS) initiative to try and reproduce results from published articles. We attempted to reproduce core findings from the work of Bingham et al., which investigates the actin organisation in presynaptic structures by using diffraction-limited and super-resolution microscopy. While the original paper unveiled clear biological insight, it lacked sufficient detail in the bioimage analysis methodological approach, limiting the depth of reproducibility we could achieve. Through frequent contacts with the corresponding author, we managed to replicate qualitative aspects of the analysis of actin nanostructures in bead-induced presynapses. We performed image reconstruction from super-resolution microscopy data, automatic image registration and visual inspection, followed by manual annotation of structures of interest in ~35 images. Our experience with this exercise highlights the importance of transparent data sharing and accessibility, as well as the need to adhere to bioimage analysis standards that ensure the reproducibility of nowadays complex biological image analysis studies. It also shows how crucial interdisciplinary collaboration is, since many biology labs are simply unaware of these standards, which are often easy to implement and would likely be widely adopted if their value was better understood or known",

    "title": "Telomerase mRNA-Lipid nanoparticles attenuate neuroinflammation after traumatic brain injury in mice",
    "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of chronic neurological disability, yet no disease-modifying therapy exists. Emerging evidence indicates that TBI activates cellular aging programs, including telomere erosion and persistent inflammation, that contribute to progressive neurodegeneration. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) preserves telomere homeostasis and provides cytoprotective effects in the central nervous system, but has not been therapeutically targeted after TBI. Here, we developed an mRNA nanotherapy consisting of mouse TERT mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (mTERT-LNPs) and evaluated it in a controlled cortical impact model of moderate TBI. We first established that TBI transiently disrupts TERT biology, with reduced cortical TERT mRNA and shortened telomeres at 3 days post-injury (dpi), followed by partial recovery by 14 dpi. mTERT-LNPs were well tolerated in vitro and in vivo. Following intravenous delivery in the acute post-injury window, LNPs localized to the injured brain and displayed expected peripheral biodistribution. A single systemic dose increased cortical TERT mRNA and protein and partially restored telomere length at 3 dpi. TERT mRNA delivery significantly reduced Iba1+ microglial activation and suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines, with modest increases in anti-inflammatory markers. Systemically, mTERT-LNPs lowered serum C-reactive protein and malondialdehyde, indicating reduced peripheral inflammation and oxidative stress, without adverse effects on body weight or peripheral organ histology. Several outcomes showed sex-dependent patterns. Collectively, these data provide the first in vivo evidence that telomerase therapy can modulate telomere biology and neuroinflammation after TBI, supporting mRNA-LNP-mediated TERT restoration as a scalable, mechanistically grounded strategy for disease modification in TBI and related disorders.",

The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

    "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
    "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

    "title": "Synaptotagmin-7 is required for synchronous but not asynchronous facilitation of glutamate release at cortical boutons",
    "content": "Short-term synaptic plasticity and the kinetics of neurotransmitter release vary widely across synapses, but population measurements obscure the mechanisms that generate this diversity. While the Ca2+ sensor Synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7) has been implicated in facilitation, vesicle replenishment and asynchronous vesicle exocytosis, its precise contributions to these processes remain debated. We used quantal-resolution imaging to measure synchronous and asynchronous glutamate release at individual cortical boutons in wild type and Syt7-/- neurons. Stratifying boutons by release efficacy and applying failure-based analysis to isolate trials where the first action potential evoked no release allowed us to separate facilitation from vesicle depletion. Syt7 deletion selectively eliminated activity-dependent facilitation of synchronous release but left facilitation of asynchronous release intact, although its overall magnitude was reduced. We further show that synchronous and asynchronous events arise from functionally distinct vesicle populations. These findings demonstrate that activity-dependent facilitation of synchronous and asynchronous exocytosis are mechanistically separable, enabling synapses to independently tune distinct temporal components of neurotransmission.",

    "title": "Human and generative AI integrate visual cues differently in a shape completion task",
    "content": "In amodal completion observers perceive complete objects despite partial occlusion. When two object parts are divided by an occluder, completion can result in perceiving one or two objects. This phenomenon involves both lower-level cues (e.g., symmetry, contour continuity) and higher-level cues (e.g., prior knowledge). Experiment 1 investigates how occluder size, familiarity, and symmetry affect human completions using a drawing task. Narrow occluders and asymmetry promote single-shape completions, while familiarity and (global) symmetry promote two-shape interpretations. Good continuation emerges as the strongest cue, with symmetry and familiarity playing increasingly important roles as occluder width increases. Experiment 2 compares human performance with three state-of-the-art generative AI models. Models often generated creative but non-compliant outputs, altering even unoccluded regions. We restricted analysis to instruction-following generations, identified through ratings by naive observers. Among compliant outputs, models showed some human-like biases (e.g., more two-shape completions for wide occluders), but failed with higher-level cues. They did not use symmetry to guide completions and showed reversed familiarity effects. Our findings highlight differences between human and AI completions. Humans integrate low- and high-level cues, whereas compliant outputs from the AI models rely primarily on low-level pattern continuation. Current AI models lack the flexible integration of multiple representational levels that characterize human perception. This work establishes an analytical framework for evaluating whether next-generation models achieve more human-like visual reasoning.",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello to everyone reading this. In this post, while it is still 2025, I will tell you about two of my libraries that you probably do not know about - <a href=\"https://github.com/x42005e1f/aiologic\">aiologic</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://github.com/x42005e1f/culsans\">culsans</a>. The irony here is that even though they are both over a year old, I keep coming across discussions in which my solutions are considered non-existent (at least, they are not mentioned, and the problems discussed remain unsolved). That is why I wrote this post - to introduce you to my libraries and the tasks they are able to solve, in order to try once again to make them more recognizable.</p> <h1>What My Projects Do</h1> <p>Both libraries provide synchronization/communication primitives (such as locks, queues, capacity limiters) that are both async-aware and thread-aware/thread-safe, and can work in different environments within a single process. Whether it is regular threads, asyncio tasks, or even gevent greenlets. For example, with <code>aiologic.Lock</code>, you can synchronize access to a shared resource for different asyncio event loops running in different threads, without blocking the event loop (which may be relevant for free-threading):</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3 import asyncio from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor from aiologic import Lock lock = Lock() THREADS = 4 TASKS = 4 TIME = 1.0 async def work() -&gt; None: async with lock: # some CPU-bound or IO-bound work await asyncio.sleep(TIME / (THREADS * TASKS)) async def main() -&gt; None: async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg: for _ in range(TASKS): tg.create_task(work()) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: with ThreadPoolExecutor(THREADS) as executor: for _ in range(THREADS): executor.submit(asyncio.run, main()) # program will end in &lt;TIME&gt; seconds </code></pre> <p>The same can be achieved using <code>aiologic.synchronized()</code>, a universal decorator that is an async-aware alternative to <a href=\"https://wrapt.readthedocs.io/en/master/examples.html#thread-synchronization\"><code>wrapt.synchronized()</code></a>, which will use <code>aiologic.RLock</code> (reentrant lock) under the hood by default:</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3 import asyncio from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor from aiologic import synchronized THREADS = 4 TASKS = 4 TIME = 1.0 @synchronized async def work(*, recursive: bool = True) -&gt; None: if recursive: await work(recursive=False) else: # some CPU-bound or IO-bound work await asyncio.sleep(TIME / (THREADS * TASKS)) async def main() -&gt; None: async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg: for _ in range(TASKS): tg.create_task(work()) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: with ThreadPoolExecutor(THREADS) as executor: for _ in range(THREADS): executor.submit(asyncio.run, main()) # program will end in &lt;TIME&gt; seconds </code></pre> <p>Want to notify a task from another thread that an action has been completed? No problem, just use <code>aiologic.Event</code>:</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3 import asyncio from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor from aiologic import Event TIME = 1.0 async def producer(event: Event) -&gt; None: # some CPU-bound or IO-bound work await asyncio.sleep(TIME) event.set() async def consumer(event: Event) -&gt; None: await event print(&quot;done!&quot;) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: with ThreadPoolExecutor(2) as executor: executor.submit(asyncio.run, producer(event := Event())) executor.submit(asyncio.run, consumer(event)) # program will end in &lt;TIME&gt; seconds </code></pre> <p>If you ensure that only one task will wait for the event and only once, you can also use low-level events as a more lightweight alternative for the same purpose (this may be convenient for creating your own future objects; note that they also have <code>cancelled()</code> method!):</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3 import asyncio from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor from aiologic import Flag from aiologic.lowlevel import AsyncEvent, Event, create_async_event TIME = 1.0 async def producer(event: Event, holder: Flag[str]) -&gt; None: # some CPU-bound or IO-bound work await asyncio.sleep(TIME) holder.set(&quot;done!&quot;) event.set() async def consumer(event: AsyncEvent, holder: Flag[str]) -&gt; None: await event print(&quot;result:&quot;, repr(holder.get())) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: with ThreadPoolExecutor(2) as executor: executor.submit(asyncio.run, producer( event := create_async_event(), holder := Flag[str](), )) executor.submit(asyncio.run, consumer(event, holder)) # program will end in &lt;TIME&gt; seconds </code></pre> <p>What about communication between tasks? Well, you can use <code>aiologic.SimpleQueue</code> as the fastest blocking queue in simple cases:</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3 import asyncio from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor from aiologic import SimpleQueue ITERATIONS = 100 TIME = 1.0 async def producer(queue: SimpleQueue[int]) -&gt; None: for i in range(ITERATIONS): # some CPU-bound or IO-bound work await asyncio.sleep(TIME / ITERATIONS) queue.put(i) async def consumer(queue: SimpleQueue[int]) -&gt; None: for i in range(ITERATIONS): value = await queue.async_get() assert value == i print(&quot;done!&quot;) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: with ThreadPoolExecutor(2) as executor: executor.submit(asyncio.run, producer(queue := SimpleQueue[int]())) executor.submit(asyncio.run, consumer(queue)) # program will end in &lt;TIME&gt; seconds </code></pre> <p>And if you need some additional features and/or compatibility with the standard queues, then <code>culsans.Queue</code> is here to help:</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3 import asyncio from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor from culsans import AsyncQueue, Queue ITERATIONS = 100 TIME = 1.0 async def producer(queue: AsyncQueue[int]) -&gt; None: for i in range(ITERATIONS): # some CPU-bound or IO-bound work await asyncio.sleep(TIME / ITERATIONS) await queue.put(i) await queue.join() print(&quot;done!&quot;) async def consumer(queue: AsyncQueue[int]) -&gt; None: for i in range(ITERATIONS): value = await queue.get() assert value == i queue.task_done() if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: with ThreadPoolExecutor(2) as executor: executor.submit(asyncio.run, producer(queue := Queue[int]().async_q)) executor.submit(asyncio.run, consumer(queue)) # program will end in &lt;TIME&gt; seconds </code></pre> <p>It may seem that aiologic &amp; culsans only work with asyncio. In fact, they also support Curio, Trio, AnyIO, and also greenlet-based eventlet and gevent libraries, and you can also interact not only with tasks, but also with native threads:</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3 import time import gevent from aiologic import CapacityLimiter CONCURRENCY = 2 THREADS = 8 TASKS = 8 TIME = 1.0 limiter = CapacityLimiter(CONCURRENCY) def sync_work() -&gt; None: with limiter: # some CPU-bound work time.sleep(TIME * CONCURRENCY / (THREADS + TASKS)) def green_work() -&gt; None: with limiter: # some IO-bound work gevent.sleep(TIME * CONCURRENCY / (THREADS + TASKS)) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: threadpool = gevent.get_hub().threadpool gevent.joinall([ *(threadpool.spawn(sync_work) for _ in range(THREADS)), *(gevent.spawn(green_work) for _ in range(TASKS)), ]) # program will end in &lt;TIME&gt; seconds </code></pre> <p>Within a single thread with different libraries as well:</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3 import trio import trio_asyncio from aiologic import Condition TIME = 1.0 async def producer(cond: Condition) -&gt; None: # Trio-flavored async with cond: # some IO-bound work await trio.sleep(TIME) if not cond.waiting: await cond cond.notify() @trio_asyncio.aio_as_trio async def consumer(cond: Condition) -&gt; None: # asyncio-flavored async with cond: if cond.waiting: cond.notify() await cond print(&quot;done!&quot;) async def main() -&gt; None: async with trio.open_nursery() as nursery: nursery.start_soon(producer, cond := Condition()) nursery.start_soon(consumer, cond) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: trio_asyncio.run(main) # program will end in &lt;TIME&gt; seconds </code></pre> <p>And, even more uniquely, some aiologic primitives also work from inside signal handlers and destructors:</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3 import time import weakref import curio from aiologic import CountdownEvent, Flag from aiologic.lowlevel import enable_signal_safety TIME = 1.0 async def main() -&gt; None: event = CountdownEvent(2) flag1 = Flag() flag2 = Flag() await curio.spawn_thread(lambda flag: time.sleep(TIME / 2), flag1) await curio.spawn_thread(lambda flag: time.sleep(TIME), flag2) weakref.finalize(flag1, enable_signal_safety(event.down)) weakref.finalize(flag2, enable_signal_safety(event.down)) del flag1 del flag2 assert not event await event print(&quot;done!&quot;) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: curio.run(main) # program will end in &lt;TIME&gt; seconds </code></pre> <p>If that is not enough for you, I suggest you try the primitives yourself in the use cases that interest you. Maybe you will even find a use for them that I have not seen myself. And of course, these are far from all the declared features, and the documentation describes much more. However, the latter is still under development...</p> <h1>Performance</h1> <p>Quite a lot of focus (perhaps even too much) has been placed on performance. After all, no matter how impressive the capabilities of general solutions may be, if they cannot compete with more specialized solutions, you will subconsciously avoid using the former whenever possible. Therefore, both libraries have a number of relevant features.</p> <p>First, all unused primitives consume significantly less memory, just like asyncio primitives (remember, my primitives are also thread-aware). As an example, this has the following interesting effect: all queues consume significantly less memory than standard ones (even compared to asyncio queues). Here are <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/agent-lightning/issues/372#issuecomment-3615552472\">some old measurements</a> (to make them more actual, add about half a kilobyte to <code>aiologic.Queue</code> and <code>aiologic.SimpleQueue</code>):</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sizeof(collections.deque) 760 &gt;&gt;&gt; sizeof(queue.SimpleQueue) 72 # see https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/140025 &gt;&gt;&gt; sizeof(queue.Queue) 3730 &gt;&gt;&gt; sizeof(asyncio.Queue) 3346 &gt;&gt;&gt; sizeof(janus.Queue) 7765 &gt;&gt;&gt; sizeof(culsans.Queue) 2152 &gt;&gt;&gt; sizeof(aiologic.Queue) 680 &gt;&gt;&gt; sizeof(aiologic.SimpleQueue) 448 &gt;&gt;&gt; sizeof(aiologic.SimpleLifoQueue) 376 &gt;&gt;&gt; sizeof(aiologic.lowlevel.lazydeque) 128 </code></pre> <p>This is true not only for unused queues, but also for partially used ones. For example, queues whose length has not yet reached maxsize will consume less memory, since the wait queue for put operations will not yet be in demand.</p> <p>Second, all aiologic primitives rely on effectively atomic operations (operations that cannot be interrupted due to the GIL and for which free-threading uses per-object locks). This makes almost all aiologic primitives faster than threading and queue primitives on PyPy, as shown in the example with semaphores:</p> <pre><code>threads = 1, value = 1: aiologic.Semaphore: 943246964 ops 100.00% fairness threading.Semaphore: 8507624 ops 100.00% fairness 110.9x speedup! threads = 2, value = 1: aiologic.Semaphore: 581026516 ops 99.99% fairness threading.Semaphore: 7664169 ops 99.87% fairness 75.8x speedup! threads = 3, value = 2: aiologic.Semaphore: 522027692 ops 99.97% fairness threading.Semaphore: 15161 ops 84.71% fairness 34431.2x speedup! threads = 5, value = 3: aiologic.Semaphore: 518826453 ops 99.89% fairness threading.Semaphore: 9075 ops 71.92% fairness 57173.9x speedup! ... threads = 233, value = 144: aiologic.Semaphore: 521016536 ops 99.24% fairness threading.Semaphore: 4872 ops 63.53% fairness 106944.9x speedup! threads = 377, value = 233: aiologic.Semaphore: 522805870 ops 99.04% fairness threading.Semaphore: 3567 ops 80.30% fairness 146564.5x speedup! ... </code></pre> <p>The benchmark is <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/x42005e1f/149d3994d5f7bd878def71d5404e6ea4\">publicly available</a>, and you can run your own measurements on your hardware with the interpreter you are interested in (for example, in free-threading you will also see a difference in favor of aiologic). So if you do not believe it, try it yourself.</p> <p><em>(Note: on a large number of threads, each pass will take longer due to the square problem mentioned in the next paragraph; perhaps the benchmark should be improved at some point...)</em></p> <p>Third, there are a number of details regarding timeouts, fairness, and the square problem. For these, I recommend reading the &quot;Performance&quot; section of the aiologic documentation.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Strictly speaking, there are no real alternatives. But here is a comparison with some similar ones:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://github.com/aio-libs/janus\">Janus</a> - provides only queues, supports only asyncio and regular threads, only one event loop, creates new tasks for non-blocking calls. The project is rarely maintained.</li> <li><a href=\"https://github.com/dabeaz/curio\">Curio</a>'s universal synchronization - provides only queues and events, supports only asyncio, Curio, and regular threads, uses the same methods for different environments, but has issues. The project was officially abandoned on December 21, 2025.</li> <li><a href=\"https://github.com/gleero/python-threadsafe-async\">python-threadsafe-async</a> - provides only events and channels, supports only asyncio and threads, uses not the most successful design solutions. The project has been inactive since March 2024.</li> <li><a href=\"https://github.com/dano/aioprocessing\">aioprocessing</a> - provides many primitives, but only supports asyncio, and due to multiprocessing support, it has far from the best performance and some limitations (for example, queues serialize all items and suffer from <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/python/projects/14/views/1?filterQuery=queue\"><code>multiprocessing.Queue</code> issues</a>). The project has been inactive since September 2022.</li> </ul> <p>You can learn a little more in the &quot;Why?&quot; section of the aiologic documentation.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Python developers, of course. But there are some nuances:</p> <ol> <li>Development status - alpha. The API is still being refined, so incompatible changes are possible. If you do not rely exclusively on high-level interfaces (available from the top-level package), it may be good practice to pin the dependent version to the current and next minor aka major release (non-deprecated + deprecated but not removed).</li> <li>Documentation is still under development (in particular, aiologic currently has placeholders in many docstrings). At the same time, if you use any AI tools, they will most likely not understand the library well due to its exotic nature (a good example of this is DeepWiki). If you need a reliable information source here and now, you should take a look at GitHub Discussions (or alternative communication channels).</li> <li>Since I am (and will likely remain) the sole developer and maintainer, there is a very serious bus factor. Therefore, since the latest versions, I have been trying to enrich the source code with detailed comments so that the libraries can at least be maintained in a viable state in forks, but there is still a lot of work to be done in this area.</li> </ol> <p>I rely on theoretical analysis of my solutions and proactive bug fixing, so all provided functionality should be reliable and work as expected (even with weak test coverage). The libraries are already in use, so I think they are suitable for production.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/x42005e1f\"> /u/x42005e1f </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1psjsnu/aiologic_culsans_a_way_to_make_multithreaded/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1psjsnu/aiologic_culsans_a_way_to_make_multithreaded/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Spikard v0.5.0 Released",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi peeps,</p> <p>I'm glad to announce that <a href=\"https://github.com/Goldziher/spikard\">Spikard</a> v0.5.0 has been released. This is the first version I consider fully functional across all supported languages.</p> <h2>What is Spikard?</h2> <p>Spikard is a <em>polyglot web toolkit</em> written in Rust and available for multiple languages:</p> <ul> <li>Rust</li> <li>Python (3.10+)</li> <li>TypeScript (Node/Bun)</li> <li>TypeScript (WASM - Deno/Edge)</li> <li>PHP (8.2+)</li> <li>Ruby (3.4+)</li> </ul> <h2>Why Spikard?</h2> <p>I had a few reasons for building this:</p> <p>I am the original author of <a href=\"https://litestar.dev/\">Litestar</a> (no longer involved after v2), and I have a thing for web frameworks. Following the work done by <a href=\"https://github.com/sparckles/Robyn\">Robyn</a> to create a Python framework with a Rust runtime (Actix in their case), I always wanted to experiment with that idea.</p> <p>I am also the author of <a href=\"https://github.com/Goldziher/html-to-markdown\">html-to-markdown</a>. When I rewrote it in Rust, I created bindings for multiple languages from a single codebase. That opened the door to a genuinely polyglot web stack.</p> <p>Finally, there is the actual pain point. I work in multiple languages across different client projects. In Python I use Litestar, Sanic, FastAPI, Django, Flask, etc. In TypeScript I use Express, Fastify, and NestJS. In Go I use Gin, Fiber, and Echo. Each framework has pros and cons (and some are mostly cons). It would be better to have one standard toolkit that is correct (standards/IETF-aligned), robust, and fast across languages.</p> <p>That is what Spikard aims to be.</p> <h2>Why &quot;Toolkit&quot;?</h2> <p>The end goal is a toolkit, not just an HTTP framework. Today, Spikard exposes an HTTP framework built on <a href=\"https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum\">axum</a> and the Tokio + Tower ecosystems in Rust, which provides:</p> <ol> <li>An extremely high-performance core that is robust and battle-tested</li> <li>A wide and deep ecosystem of extensions and middleware</li> </ol> <p>This currently covers HTTP use cases (REST, JSON-RPC, WebSockets) plus OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and OpenRPC code generation.</p> <p>The next step is to cover queues and task managers (RabbitMQ, Kafka, NATS) and CloudEvents interoperability, aiming for a full toolkit. A key inspiration here is <a href=\"https://watermill.io/\">Watermill</a> in Go.</p> <h2>Current Features and Capabilities</h2> <ul> <li>REST with typed routing (e.g. <code>/users/{id:uuid}</code>)</li> <li>JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP and WebSocket</li> <li>HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2</li> <li>Streaming responses, SSE, and WebSockets</li> <li>Multipart file uploads, URL-encoded and JSON bodies</li> <li>Tower-HTTP middleware stack (compression, rate limiting, timeouts, request IDs, CORS, auth, static files)</li> <li>JSON Schema validation (Draft 2020-12) with structured error payloads (RFC 9457)</li> <li>Lifecycle hooks (<code>onRequest</code>, <code>preValidation</code>, <code>preHandler</code>, <code>onResponse</code>, <code>onError</code>)</li> <li>Dependency injection across bindings</li> <li>Codegen: OpenAPI 3.1, AsyncAPI 2.x/3.x, OpenRPC 1.3.2</li> <li>Fixture-driven E2E tests across all bindings (400+ scenarios)</li> <li>Benchmark + profiling harness in CI</li> </ul> <p>Language-specific validation integrations:</p> <ul> <li>Python: msgspec (required), with optional detection of Pydantic v2, attrs, dataclasses</li> <li>TypeScript: Zod</li> <li>Ruby: dry-schema / dry-struct detection when present</li> <li>PHP: native validation with PSR-7 interfaces</li> <li>Rust: serde + schemars</li> </ul> <h2>Roadmap to v1.0.0</h2> <p><strong>Core:</strong> - Protobuf + protoc integration - GraphQL (queries, mutations, subscriptions) - Plugin/extension system</p> <p><strong>DX:</strong> - MCP server and AI tooling integration - Expanded documentation site and example apps</p> <p><strong>Post-1.0 targets:</strong> - HTTP/3 (QUIC) - CloudEvents support - Queue protocols (AMQP, Kafka, etc.)</p> <h2>Benchmarks</h2> <p>We run continuous benchmarks + profiling in CI. Everything is measured on GitHub-hosted machines across multiple iterations and normalized for relative comparison.</p> <p>Latest comparative run (2025-12-20, Linux x86_64, AMD EPYC 7763 2c/4t, 50 concurrency, 10s, oha):</p> <ul> <li>spikard-rust: 55,755 avg RPS (1.00 ms avg latency)</li> <li>spikard-node: 24,283 avg RPS (2.22 ms avg latency)</li> <li>spikard-php: 20,176 avg RPS (2.66 ms avg latency)</li> <li>spikard-python: 11,902 avg RPS (4.41 ms avg latency)</li> <li>spikard-wasm: 10,658 avg RPS (5.70 ms avg latency)</li> <li>spikard-ruby: 8,271 avg RPS (6.50 ms avg latency)</li> </ul> <p>Full artifacts for that run are committed under <code>snapshots/benchmarks/20397054933</code> in the repo.</p> <h2>Development Methodology</h2> <p>Spikard is, for the most part, &quot;vibe coded.&quot; I am saying that openly. The tools used are Codex (OpenAI) and Claude Code (Anthropic). How do I keep quality high? By following an outside-in approach inspired by TDD.</p> <p>The first major asset added was an extensive set of fixtures (JSON files that follow a schema I defined). These cover the range of HTTP framework behavior and were derived by inspecting the test suites of multiple frameworks and relevant IETF specs.</p> <p>Then I built an E2E test generator that uses the fixtures to generate suites for each binding. That is the TDD layer.</p> <p>On top of that, I follow BDD in the literal sense: Benchmark-Driven Development. There is a profiling + benchmarking harness that tracks regressions and guides optimization.</p> <p>With those in place, the code evolved via ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) in <code>docs/adr</code>. The Rust core came first; bindings were added one by one as E2E tests passed. Features were layered on top of that foundation.</p> <h2>Getting Involved</h2> <p>If you want to get involved, there are a few ways:</p> <ol> <li>Join the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/wb8SEWvM\">Kreuzberg Discord</a></li> <li>Use Spikard and report issues, feature requests, or API feedback</li> <li>Help spread the word (always helpful)</li> <li>Contribute: refactors, improvements, tests, docs</li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Goldziher\"> /u/Goldziher </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1psv340/spikard_v050_released/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1psv340/spikard_v050_released/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It is designed to be a &quot;batteries-included&quot; solution that doesn't compromise on speed or developer ergonomics.</p> <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Performance:</strong> It allows for Python free-threading (GIL-free) and includes automatic zstd/gzip/brotli/deflate decompression.</li> <li><strong>Dual Interface:</strong> Provides both Asynchronous and Synchronous clients with nearly identical interfaces.</li> <li><strong>Modern Python:</strong> Fully type-safe with complete type hints.</li> <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Full test coverage, no <code>unsafe</code> Rust code, and zero Python-side dependencies.</li> <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Highly customizable via middleware and custom JSON serializers.</li> <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Built-in mocking utilities and support for connecting directly to ASGI apps.</li> </ul> <p><strong>All standard HTTP features are supported:</strong></p> <ul> <li>HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2</li> <li>TLS/HTTPS via <code>rustls</code></li> <li>Connection pooling, streaming, and multipart forms</li> <li>Cookie management, proxies, redirects, and timeouts</li> <li>Automatic charset detection and decoding</li> </ul> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <ul> <li>Developers working in high-concurrency scenarios who need maximum throughput and low latency.</li> <li>Teams looking for a single, type-safe library that handles both sync and async use cases.</li> <li>Rust developers working in Python who miss the ergonomics of <code>reqwest</code>.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>I have benchmarked <code>pyreqwest</code> against the most popular Python HTTP clients. You can view the full benchmarks <a href=\"https://github.com/MarkusSintonen/pyreqwest/blob/main/docs/benchmarks.md\">here</a>.</p> <ul> <li><strong>vs Httpx:</strong> While <code>httpx</code> is the standard for modern async Python, <code>pyreqwest</code> aims to solve performance bottlenecks inherent in pure-Python implementations (specifically regarding connection pooling and request handling issues <code>httpx</code>/<code>httpcore</code> have) while offering similarly modern API.</li> <li><strong>vs Aiohttp:</strong> <code>pyreqwest</code> supports HTTP/2 out of the box (which <code>aiohttp</code> lacks) and provides a synchronous client variant, making it more versatile for different contexts.</li> <li><strong>vs Urllib3:</strong> <code>pyreqwest</code> offers a modern async interface and better developer ergonomics with fully typed interfaces</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/MarkusSintonen/pyreqwest\">https://github.com/MarkusSintonen/pyreqwest</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/pyreqwest\"> /u/pyreqwest </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pswh1o/pyreqwest_an_extremely_fast_gilfree_featurerich/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pswh1o/pyreqwest_an_extremely_fast_gilfree_featurerich/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Spatial Navigation Training Enhances Large-Scale and Small-Scale Spatial Abilities through Different Neural Mechanisms",
    "content": "Elucidating the relationship between large-scale and small-scale spatial abilities is fundamental to advancing our understanding of spatial cognition, with training transfer effects across tasks offering a direct means of exploration. This study investigated how large-scale spatial navigation training influences both large- and small-scale spatial abilities and their underlying neural mechanisms. Participants completed 20 days of real-world campus navigation training and performed large-scale (distance judgment) and small-scale (paper folding) spatial tasks before and after training. The training group showed significant improvements in both tasks, whereas the control group did not. Brain imaging revealed increased activation in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) during large-scale task performance after training. In contrast, improvements in the small-scale task were associated with reduced deactivation in the right postcentral gyrus (PoCG), right precuneus, and left superior temporal gyrus (STG). Overall, these findings indicate that large-scale navigation training enhances spatial ability across scales through distinct neural mechanisms, supporting the partial dissociation model and highlighting the contribution of negatively activated regions to spatial processing.",

    "title": "SynSpine: an automated workflow for the generation of longitudinal spinal cord synthetic MRI data",
    "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",

    "title": "Altering visual feedback during reaching: no mitigating effect on pain for individuals with complex regional pain syndrome, but visuomotor adaptation is preserved",
    "content": "IntroductionComplex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is often associated with pain-related fear of movement, and virtual reality has been proposed as a potential rehabilitation intervention to overcome this issue. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to test whether altering the visual feedback (VF) on movement could mitigate pain and promote movement.MethodsFifteen participants with upper-limb CRPS and 15 age- and gender-matched pain-free participants undertook a target reaching task in the Kinarm exoskeleton, with two VF conditions being tested (Per Exposure: GREATER or SMALLER VF; two separate sessions), preceded and followed by reaching movements without VF (Pre-/Post-Exposure). Proprioception was assessed with a Limb Position Sense task, and a Movement Accuracy outcome was derived from the Pre-Exposure reaching movements.ResultsContrary to our hypothesis, pain intensity was not influenced by VF conditions but increased over Time (p < 0.001). Analyses performed on kinematics data showed that participants displayed visuomotor adaptation both Per Exposure, and Pre-/Post-Exposure to altered VF (VF condition*Time: p < 0.001). Per Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants tended to adapt their Movement Length to a lesser extent than pain-free participants (Group*VF condition: p = 0.048). Pre-/Post-Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants consistently performed larger movements than pain-free participants (p = 0.002). Both groups performed similarly for the Limb Position Sense task, but CRPS participants displayed significantly larger errors for Movement Accuracy, suggesting impaired proprioceptive integration in the CRPS group.DiscussionThese findings support the idea that visuomotor adaptation is preserved in CRPS and can be used to promote movement.",

    "title": "Identification of cognitive predictors of remission in depression following limited effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on hot and cold cognitive systems",
    "content": "IntroductionCognitive dysfunction is a chronic and debilitating element of major depressive disorder (MDD), which manifests as abnormal processing in hot (emotion-laden) and cold (emotion-independent) cognitive systems. Although the antidepressant properties of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are well-established, its impact on hot and cold cognition requires further elucidation.MethodsProspective study of patients with MDD undergoing an acute course of high frequency rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). MDD patients (N\u202f=\u202f24) received a 4-to-6-week course of rTMS during which they were evaluated for depressive symptoms and completed cognitive assessments. Age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (N\u202f=\u202f33) also completed the cognitive tasks at the same intervals as the MDD patients.ResultsSustained antidepressant effect was observed following rTMS in MDD patients. Hot and cold cognition remained unaltered over the course of treatment. A pre-treatment baseline cognitive phenotype of those who achieve remission of their depressive symptoms with rTMS was identified, characterized by greater sustained attention, speed in correct identification of facial expressions, and free recall of words.ConclusionOur findings further validate the cognitive safety and clinical efficacy of rTMS as an intervention for MDD. Future research is required to further characterize the utility of pre-rTMS cognitive phenotyping in identified remitters, to aid in patient selection and treatment prognostication.",

    "title": "Comparison of contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities",
    "content": "IntroductionThe purpose of the study was to investigate potential differences in contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities. Based on the different neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints in the central part of the neural system for proximal and distal muscles, it was hypothesized that contralateral muscle excitation (CME) would be higher for proximal than distal muscles.MethodsThirteen university students participated in this study. The participants performed isometric flexion movements with the shoulder and index finger of the dominant arm at four different relative force levels (25, 50, 75, 100%). Force was measured with a force transducer connected to the index finger and elbow on the dominant arm. Muscle excitation was measured using sEMG placed on the flexor carpi radialis (distal condition) and the anterior deltoid (proximal condition) on the non-dominant arm.ResultsCME was observed in both proximal and distal muscles, with proximal muscles displaying significantly higher CME at higher force levels (50, 75, and 100%). In the proximal condition, contractions with the dominant anterior deltoid were associated with a progressive increase in CME across force levels in the contralateral homologous muscle. In contrast, for the distal condition (flexor carpi radialis), CME changes were only evident when comparing the lowest and highest force levels.ConclusionThe results are in coherence with the differences in neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints for bilateral communication for proximal versus distal muscles. The present results encourage further neurophysiological studies using direct brain activity measures to explore the potential link between the differences in bilateral communication and CME for proximal versus distal muscles.",

    "title": "Psilocybin modulates social behaviour in male and female mice in a time-dependent manner",
    "content": "With the resurgence of psychedelic research and the growing interest in their therapeutic potential, there is an urgent need to understand how these compounds act across biological sexes. Despite widespread interest in their use for conditions marked by social impairments, including depression, anxiety, and anorexia nervosa, the influence of sex as a biological variable (SABV) on the prosocial effects of psychedelics remains poorly understood. Indeed, enhanced connectedness, sociability and empathy are common outcomes of psychedelic use and these have shaped human social structures for millennia. Here, we investigated the sex-specific effects of a single dose of psilocybin (1.5 mg/kg) in C57BL/6J mice on various aspects of social behaviours. We show an intriguing connection between huddling behaviour and body temperature acutely elicited by psilocybin that was restricted to females. We also observe temporally distinct patterns of social behaviour alterations in female mice, whereby enhanced preference for social novelty was observed after acute effects subsided (4 h post-administration), which was maintained for ~24 h. Longer-term, the impact of psilocybin was reversed and promoted preference for familiar over novel conspecifics when assessed 7d post-administration, which was associated with prolonged nucleus accumbens dopamine signalling during familiar sniffing. In males, psilocybin reduced stress-related behaviours at 24 h and increased preference for familiar conspecifics, along with blunted novelty-evoked dopamine responses at both 24 h and 7 days post-treatment. Both 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors were involved in modulating these behaviours, though in sex-specific ways. These findings highlight that the prosocial effects of psychedelics are not universal and emphasize the importance of sex-informed approaches in both preclinical research and clinical application.",

    "title": "ADGRG1 blockade drives astrocyte positioning into the extracellular matrix to reduce scar size",
    "content": "After the central nervous system (CNS) injury, inflammatory cells enter the lesion core and a fibrotic extracellular matrix accumulates. Astrocytes subsequently cluster around this matrix, forming a glial scar, but the role of the extracellular matrix in scar formation remains poorly understood. Here, we identify type III collagen, a major fibrotic extracellular matrix component after spinal cord injury, as a key regulator of astrocyte behavior. Using single-nucleus transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and time-lapse cell imaging, we show that type III collagen positions astrocytes at the boundary of the fibrotic matrix by activating the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor G1 (ADGRG1) and its downstream effector RhoA. Blocking ADGRG1 genetically or pharmacologically allows astrocytes to enter the fibrotic matrix, resulting in a smaller scar, improved neuronal regeneration, and better motor recovery. The migration of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes was inhibited by type III collagen via the ADGRG1-RhoA pathway, supporting their therapeutic potential. Our findings reveal the importance of controlling glial scar positioning via the type III collagen-ADGRG1 axis, providing a novel therapeutic target for CNS injury.",

    "title": "Simulated auditory nerve response evoked by lateral-wall and peri-modiolar electrode arrays inserted in scala tympani or scala vestibuli",
    "content": "IntroductionCochlear implants (CIs) are neuroprosthetic devices designed to restore hearing in individuals with severe to profound hearing loss. Clinically, CI electrode arrays differ by location, either peri-modiolar (pm) positioned near the cochlear axis, or lateral-wall (lw), placed closer to the peripheral terminals of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs). Standard insertion is into the scala tympani (ST), though the scala vestibuli (SV) is considered for cases of severe ST ossification.MethodsThis computational study investigates the neural responses of both healthy and degenerated ANFs to monopolar stimulation from electrode arrays at different locations. Using a 3D finite element model of the human cochlea, we evaluated threshold excitations for short monophasic pulses across 25 traced ANF pathways. Four array configurations were compared (pmST, pmSV, lwST, lwSV), each with electrodes directly targeting the traced fibers.ResultsResults show that excitation thresholds and stimulation specificity depend on both neural health and array position. Specificity, defined by minimizing off-target fiber stimulation, was highest for healthy ANFs with lwSV, followed by pmST, lwST, and pmSV, influenced by electrode orientation. Simulated ST ossification, modeled as decreased conductivity, generally led to reduced cathodic thresholds, suggesting that ST insertion may still be advantageous even with developing or partial ossification.DiscussionThe pmST array consistently offered reliable outcomes across varying electrode configuration and neural conditions. These findings support considering SV insertion when ST is obstructed and highlight factors influencing CI performance based on array location and neural status.",

    "title": "Charge density of multi-channel intra-cortical micro-stimulation modulates intensity and naturalness of evoked somatosensations",
    "content": "Human patients with somatosensory loss often experience severe motor deficits, causing profound challenges to independently accomplish typical tasks of daily life. Brain\u2013machine Interfaces (BMIs) offer the potential to restore lost functionality through direct electrical stimulation of the somatosensory cortex via intra-cortical micro-stimulation (ICMS). By modulating temporal patterns of stimulation, our group has previously shown single-channel ICMS can evoke both naturalistic cutaneous and proprioceptive sensory feedback. However, accurate modulation of the sensory feedback\u2019s qualia (somatotopic location, intensity and description) will be critical for fluid, dexterous motor control. In nonhuman primate studies, multi-channel ICMS has shown promise in improving quantifiable metrics such as reaction time. In recent human work, multi-channel ICMS has improved discrimination performance; however, evoked qualia from multi-channel ICMS has not been well characterized. We hypothesized multi-channel ICMS could evoke unique qualia compared to single-channel. A human participant with tetraplegia and chronically implanted microelectrode arrays in primary somatosensory cortex, reported perceptual thresholds, sensation descriptions, intensity and somatotopic locations of single- and multi-channel ICMS patterns. We found multi-channel ICMS patterns evoked unique qualia compared to single-channel ICMS. To investigate the role of charge in producing these unique evoked sensory percepts, we delivered equal amounts of charge with differing spatial patterns across multiple electrodes. Multi-channel ICMS substantially reduced the minimum stimulation amplitude required to evoked somatosensations, lowering the charge per electrode detection threshold, while increasing the total charge injected. Delivered charge across multiple electrodes, positively modulated the sensation\u2019s perceived intensity; providing early evidence of spatial integration of ICMS in the target network. Multi-channel ICMS resulted in more frequent verbal reports of \u2018natural\u2019 sensation descriptors (100% vs 85% for single-channel ICMS, p-val < 0.05) and robustly evoked sensations with high repeatability in stable somatotopic locations. Multi-channel ICMS patterns demonstrated improvements in reliability, somatotopic coverage and \u2018natural-ness\u2019 of the evoked sensations, marking significant advances towards state-of-the-art somatosensory BMIs. By better understanding of the input/output relationship for somatosensory feedback BMIs, we can expect to improve movement accuracy and increase embodiment for human users.",

    "title": "Hybrid KLT\u2014LSTM Tracking for Robust Organ Motion Monitoring in 2D Ultrasound-Guided End-Organ Therapies",
    "content": "Objective: Recent research highlights the potential of ultrasound (US) stimulation as a noninvasive tool for modulating neural and cellular signaling in the spleen and liver to treat inflammatory diseases and diabetes. However, challenges like nerve activation failures, off-target stimulation, and organ motion during respiration can affect treatment efficacy. This study introduces a novel tracking framework for accurate liver and spleen motion tracking using US imaging to overcome these challenges. Methods: The tracking framework integrates an enhanced Kanade\u2013Lucas\u2013Tomasi (EKLT) tracker with a long short-term memory (LSTM) predictor. The EKLT tracker provides precise annotations that improve LSTM training, while the LSTM compensates for occlusions and noise by making predictions based on prior data and dynamically adjusting the region of interest (ROI). Spleen motion tracking was evaluated using 40 recordings from 10 participants, each undergoing four distinct breathing patterns. Additionally, the method was evaluated on a liver motion dataset from MICCAI, collected from 9 subjects. Results: Spleen tracking was most accurate during slow, shallow breathing, with an average error of 0.4 $\\pm$ 0.4 mm, and had an average error of 1.37 $\\pm$ 0.9 mm during fast, deep breathing. Liver tracking results showed high accuracy with an average error of 0.3 $\\pm$ 0.2 mm. Conclusion: The EKLT-LSTM framework offers advantages over previous tracking models, providing high accuracy in tracking liver and spleen motion under occlusion and noisy conditions. Significance: The EKLT-LSTM is suitable for end-organ modulation applications and can be adapted to other ultrasound-guided therapies and bioelectronic medicine.",

    "title": "Personalizing the Pressure Reactivity Index for Quantifying Cerebral Autoregulation in Neurocritical Care",
    "content": "Objective: The Pressure Reactivity Index (PRx) is a common metric for assessing cerebral autoregulation in neurocritical care. This study aimed to enhance the clinical utility of PRx by developing a personalized PRx algorithm (pPRx) and identifying ideal hyperparameters. Methods: Algorithmic errors were quantified using simulated data and multimodal monitoring data from traumatic brain injury patients from the Track-TBI dataset. Using linear regression, heart rate was identified as a potential cause of PRx error. The pPRx method was developed by reparameterizing PRx averaging to heartbeats. Ideal hyperparameters for the standard PRx algorithm were identified that minimized algorithmic errors. Results: PRx was sensitive to hyperparameters and patient variability. Errors were related to patient heart rates. By parameterizing PRx to heartbeats, the pPRx methodology significantly reduced noise and sensitivity to both patient variability and hyperparameter selection. In the standard PRx algorithm, averaging windows of 10 seconds and correlation windows of 40 samples resulted in the lowest overall error. Conclusion: Personalized PRx enhances the robustness and accuracy of cerebral autoregulation estimation by addressing patient- and hyperparameter-sensitivity. This improvement is crucial for reliable clinical decision-making in neurocritical care. Significance: Robust estimation of cerebral autoregulation would be beneficial for identifying precision medicine targets and improving outcomes for neurocritical care patients. We systematically increased the robustness of PRx to make it more consistent across patient populations.",

    "title": "Quantifying the Role of Duodenal Shape in Flow and Mixing: A Computational Fluid Dynamics Study on Anatomically Diverse Models",
    "content": "Objective: Enzymatic digestion of food and absorption of nutrients in the duodenum are affected by flow and mixing driven by peristaltic contractions. Our understanding of how the duodenum shape varies among individuals and how these anatomical differences affect the transport dynamics is limited. Methods: A landmark-free approach was used to perform statistical shape analysis of the duodenum, then computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with anatomically realistic peristaltic contractions were used to characterize the effect of anatomical variations on flow and mixing. Leveraging the inherent tubular \u2018C\u2019 shape of the duodenum, centerlines and cross-sectional areas were computed for CT data from 34 subjects. The average radius and duodenal orientation in the form of the components of the tangent vectors to the centerline at 60 equally spaced (normalised by the centerline length) locations were used as inputs to a principal component analysis (PCA). Results: CFD simulations revealed similar flow features across all geometries including the location of stagnation points and the presence of reversed flow, and swirling patterns. The most extreme geometry, experiencing the largest magnitude of radial contractions, achieved a mixing state approximately twice that of the mean geometry within a 60 s period. Conclusion: This work provides new insights into duodenal shape variation and its impacts on intestinal fluid dynamics. Significance: The methods and datasets developed here have broader implications for understanding gastrointestinal function, digestion, and drug delivery by establishing quantitative links between anatomical variation and digestive processes.",

    "title": "EEG-based meditation decoding: tackling subject variability with spatial and temporal alignment",
    "content": "Objective. Meditation and mindfulness are increasingly recognized as important in improving mental well-being. However, electroencephalography (EEG)-based neurofeedback systems supporting these practices typically fail to generalize to unseen subjects. This study investigates the application of both spatial and spectral alignment to EEG to improve the classification of meditation and rest states for new subjects without any model retraining. Approach. Two unsupervised domain adaptation techniques are employed to reduce differences between subjects in their EEG recordings. The first, Riemannian Space Data Alignment (RSDA), adjusts and brings together patterns of brain activity across electrodes (spatial domain). The second, Convolutional Monge Mapping Normalization (CMMN), aligns the distribution of brain rhythms across frequencies (spectral domain). Each method is evaluated separately, in combination, and in interaction with z-score normalization. Classification between meditation and rest is performed on the aligned time series using EEGNet, a compact convolutional neural network architecture, with leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation to assess generalization across subjects. All experiments are based on a publicly available dataset of meditation EEG recordings from 53 subjects, including both novice and expert meditators. Main results. The combined RSDA+CMMN approach significantly improved LOSO classification accuracy (66.6%) compared to non-aligned (55.7%) and z-score normalized (59.6%) baselines, even though it did not improve overall harmonization. Spectral analysis identified consistent classification contributions from the Theta (4\u20138\u2009Hz), Alpha (8\u201314\u2009Hz), and Beta (14\u201330\u2009Hz) bands, while spatial analysis highlighted Frontopolar and Temporal regions as critical for distinguishing the mental states of meditation and rest. Significance. This work is the first to explore both spatial and spectral alignment in subject-independent meditation decoding for improved cross-subject generalization. Aligning EEG time series without retraining provides a practical solution for real-time neurofeedback, thereby reducing subject variability and paving the way toward calibration-free neurotechnology that supports mental well-being.",

    "title": "Improving Calibration of EMG-Informed Neuromusculoskeletal Models Through Differentiable Physics and Muscle Synergies",
    "content": "Objective: Electromyogram (EMG)-informed neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) models can predict physiologically plausible muscle forces and joint moments. However, calibrating model parameters (e.g., optimal fiber length, tendon slack length) to the individual is time-consuming, with the optimization often requiring hours to converge and typically not accounting for unrecorded muscle excitations. This study addresses these limitations by incorporating differentiable physics and muscle synergies into the calibration of NMS models. Methods: We implemented an NMS model with auto-differentiable Hill-type muscles, enabling the use of adaptive gradient descent optimizers. Two types of calibration were evaluated: a standard EMG-driven approach and a synergy-hybrid approach that also synthesized unrecorded excitations. These methods were evaluated using upper and lower limb data, each from a single participant. Results: The calibration time was reduced by up to 26 times while maintaining comparable accuracy in joint moment predictions. Compared to the EMG-driven calibration, the synergy-hybrid calibration improved the estimates of model parameters for reduced number of EMG channels. Conclusion: Auto-differentiable Hill-type muscle models greatly reduce NMS model calibration time and enable the synthesis of unrecorded muscle excitations through muscle synergies, facilitating the calibration of all muscle parameters. Significance: This new rapid calibration could support deployment of NMS models in time-sensitive applications, including real-time biomechanical analyses and personalized neurorehabilitation.",

    "title": "Compression-Enabled Joint Entropy Estimation for Seizure Detection on Human Intracortical Electroencephalography",
    "content": "Objective: Of the 1% of the world population with epilepsy, one-third have drug-resistant epilepsy and often turn to surgical intervention. Current epilepsy treatment relies on manual review by epileptologists and could benefit from reliable quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) approaches to speed up evaluation, minimize inter-reviewer variance, and deliver higher quality and more equitable care. Methods: We present the inverse compression ratio (ICR), an estimate of an upper bound of joint entropy using common compression algorithms, as a potential qEEG method for seizure detection. This technique was tested on our repository of 10 kHz intracortical neurophysiological data across 30 participants (15 adults and 15 children, 240+ total seizures). Results: Single-electrode ICR achieved a F1 score of 0.80 and an area under precision-recall curve of 0.69, outperforming conventional qEEG methods. Multielectrode ICR performed within the top 2% of individual electrodes, potentially eliminating the need for electrode selection. Conclusion: ICR may be useful for automated seizure detection; its integration into clinical systems may translate to broad clinical impact. Significance: We believe this clinical study analyzed the largest volume of continuous, multi-day intracortical neuroelectrophysiology for quantitative methods\u2013with 2,900+ recording hours (420,000+ electrode-hours, amounting to 30+ TB of data). It is also the first demonstration of compression-based multidimensional estimation in a biological or clinical application. By computing an ensemble effect without linear assumptions or parametric modeling, ICR offers a model-free solution to the classically combinatorially intractable problem of high-dimensional joint entropy; its application likely extends beyond epilepsy to other domains of biomedical signal processing.",

    "title": "Invariant activity sequences across the mouse brain",
    "content": "An ambition of neuroscience is to identify fundamental patterns of neural activity that are shared across the brain. Such patterns may occur in the cerebral cortex, where neurons are coupled to the population and fire in 50-100 ms sequences. Here we show that these sequences are stable over time and ubiquitous across the brain. Chronic Neuropixels recordings in mouse visual cortex revealed that each neuron was coupled to the local population with a characteristic strength and delay. Stimulus responses formed a sequence where neuronal participation depended on tuning, but delay was fixed. This sequence interacted multiplicatively with the rate code, appeared even during spontaneous activity, and remained stable for weeks. Brainwide Neuropixels recordings revealed that the sequences occur across the entire mouse brain and are often synchronized across regions. These results reveal a stable scaffold for brainwide activity and suggest that the sequences support a canonical computation operating across the brain.",

    "title": "Ephaptic coupling can explain variability in neural activity",
    "content": "The waxing and waning cortical oscillatory power correlates with function and disease. This cross-trial variability has been thought to be due to neuromodulation, uncertainty encoding, and/or changes in cortical excitability. Here, we report evidence that it is also due to fluctuations in ephaptic influences of mesoscale electric fields. We analyzed LFP data from the PFC recorded during a spatial delay saccade task. We constructed a model that describes the electric field close to the cortical patch given the neural activity that generates it. This revealed that field-to-neuron interactions (ephaptic coupling strength) was stronger that neuron-to-field and it correlated trial by trial changes in oscillatory power. This suggests a form of circular causality where neural activity and extracellular electric fields continuously shape each other. These results further suggest that mesoscale ephaptic effects help drive the formation of memory ensembles, a prediction of the cytoelectric coupling hypothesis.",

    "content": "Understanding how spinal circuits shape motor neuron behavior during muscle contractions remains a major challenge. Here, we combined large-scale motor unit recordings with simulation-based inference to generate probabilistic estimates of homonymous and heteronymous recurrent inhibition, a key spinal circuit that has remained mostly inaccessible during natural voluntary contractions. We constructed synchronization cross-histograms from motor neuron spike trains and extracted features representative of recurrent inhibition. Because these features are influenced by higher-frequency components of common synaptic input, we developed a simulation-based inference framework to disentangle these effects. Following validation, we applied this framework to experimental data from six muscles and two contraction intensities, revealing previously uncharacterized muscle- and intensity-dependent patterns: recurrent inhibition decreased with contraction intensity in most muscles but increased in the vastus lateralis and medialis. The pipeline is openly available and designed for reuse on comparable datasets and adaptation to diverse experimental contexts, including other spinal circuits.",

    "content": "Sensory dysfunction during aging results in sharp increases in the incidence of chronic itch and pain, which counterintuitively are associated with reduced sensitivity to light touch. While age-related changes in peripheral mechanosensory transmission have been described, the contribution central mechanisms make to altered itch and pain responses remains largely unknown. Here, we show that signalling from cutaneous touch receptors is essential for maintaining the cellular composition of the central somatosensory circuits that process itch and pain information in adult mice. In particular, the loss of excitatory signalling from Merkel cells during aging causes the degeneration of subsets of molecularly defined inhibitory and excitatory neurons in the dorsal spinal cord, including inhibitory neurons that express the neuropeptide NPY. Our demonstration that the activity-dependent loss of inhibitory NPY neurons drives itch and pain hypersensitivity in old animals reveals the mechanism by which aging reconfigures the central neuronal circuits that sense touch, itch and pain.",

    "title": "Visual input drives diverse ER calcium signals in neurons in vivo",
    "content": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has long been thought to shape calcium signals in neurons, but stimulus-driven ER calcium fluctuations have not been directly measured in vivo. To measure neuronal ER calcium signals in vivo, we paired visual stimulus presentation with two photon imaging of ER and cytosolic calcium reporters in four different cell types in the Drosophila visual system. We found that visual input elicits diverse ER calcium signals, with the ER acting as a calcium sink or source depending on the cell type, subcellular compartment (dendrite versus axon), and type of visual stimulus. ER calcium signals were not simply a reflection of cytosolic signals, indicating that the ER, rather than acting as a passive calcium buffer, actively processes calcium signals in neurons in a context-specific fashion. Thus, ER-based signal processing may contribute to functional diversity across neuronal cell types, thereby enhancing the computational capacity of neural circuits.",

    "title": "Single cell RNA sequencing reveals limited effects of Lrrk2 genotype in a mouse model of acute CNS inflammation",
    "content": "Abstract BACKGROUND: Previous data implicates neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Of the genes associated with PD, Leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has previously been proposed to play a role in neuroinflammation. However, the extent to which LRRK2 is involved in endogenous inflammatory signaling is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether endogenous mutations in LRRK2 affect responses to neuroinflammation in vivo. METHODS: We injected cohorts of mice with knock-in mutations in Lrrk2, homologous to those causing human PD, with a single intrastriatal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or control. We used single cell RNA-Sequencing to examine cell type specific responses to treatment and genotype and validated key results with orthogonal approaches. RESULTS: We found that our chosen paradigm of acute LPS exposure evokes robust transcriptional changes consistent with a multicellular neuroinflammatory response. We also found evidence of peripheral immune cell recruitment into the brain and interaction with brain-resident microglia. However, the transcriptional effects of Lrrk2 mutations were limited to small numbers of genes, including down regulation of gene ontogeny terms related to lysosomes, in microglia. CONCLUSIONS: Our data clearly demonstrate that many cells in the brain respond to a single inflammatory insult with strong transcriptional responses and that, even in a model focused on CNS injection, there is interaction between peripheral and central immune cells. In contrast, the quantitative effects of Lrrk2 mutations are modest at the transcriptional level, demonstrating that additional studies are needed to clarify whether Lrrk2 mutations affect neuroinflammation in an endogenous context.",

    "title": "Fast and slow learning mediated by distinct climbing fiber signals",
    "content": "Learning involving the cerebellum is primarily driven by climbing fiber inputs to Purkinje cells. While the encoding properties of these instructive signals have been characterized extensively in trained animals, it is unclear how they are shaped by learning across both slow and fast timescales. Here, we use longitudinal 2-photon calcium imaging to record the dynamics of climbing fiber inputs across multiple cerebellar lobules as mice learn to execute a visuomotor integration task - slow learning - and must then rapidly adapt to a new sensorimotor coupling - fast learning. Instructive signals are spatially segregated in trained mice: Lobule V preferentially encodes movement predictively, while Lobule simplex preferentially receives reward-related feedback. Moreover, the encoding of sensorimotor and reward-related instructive signals is dynamic on both slow and fast timescales: movement-related activity emerges over the course of training, while reward-related activity progressively diminishes as mice become experts but re-emerges specifically in Lobule simplex when rewards become scarce. Finally, while the same climbing fiber inputs can change on both timescales, the magnitude and spatial organization of slow changes are not related to fast changes. Thus, climbing fiber inputs convey common yet complementary instructive signals that are dynamically shaped by learning on multiple time scales through distinct processes.",

    "title": "Neocortical temporal patterning by a two-layered regulatory network",
    "content": "In the developing neocortex, a diverse array of neurons with defined types and abundances are systematically generated by a limited population of radial glial progenitors (RGPs) as they undergo successive fate changes. The molecular regulation behind this intricate temporal patterning remains elusive. We undertook in-depth single-cell multi-omics analyses, discovering a two-layered regulatory framework at the core of this process. Central to this are global temporal regulators positioned above a temporal network, consisting of series of transcriptional factor (TF) hub groups under sequential state transitions. This temporal network operates not by restricting TF expressions to discrete temporal windows, but through coordinated transcriptional and chromatin-accessibility dynamics that modulate transient TF regulatory activity. Moreover, global temporal regulators specify the duration of each cascading stage and, consequently, the number of progenies generated at each stage. Loss of global temporal regulators protracts RGP lineage progression, whereas their increased activity accelerates it. These findings suggest a two-layer temporal regulatory system controlling RGP lineage progression and neural progeny output duality in mammalian neocortical development.",

    "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",

    "title": "Lightweight deep learning models for EEG decoding: a review",
    "content": "Brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technology enables direct communication between the human brain and external devices by decoding electroencephalography (EEG)signals into actionable commands. As a noninvasive and portable modality, EEG-based BCIs hold promise for applications ranging from neurorehabilitation to assistive technologies. However, their performance depends critically on the accurate extraction of relevant neural features and the reliable recognition of underlying patterns. Deep learning has transformed this process. By automatically learning complex, task-relevant representations from raw or minimally processed EEG data, deep neural networks have surpassed many traditional handcrafted feature approaches in both accuracy and adaptability. Yet, the substantial computational and memory demands of many deep learning architectures limit their deployment in portable or real-time BCI systems. This challenge has motivated a growing interest in lightweight models-architectures optimized to reduce complexity while preserving or even enhancing performance. This paper provides a systematic review of such lightweight deep learning models for EEG signal classification. To organize this landscape, existing approaches are categorized into three main strategies: (1) information integration strategies based on multi-scale feature fusion, (2) hidden layer optimization strategies, and (3) hybrid improvement strategies based on structural optimization. The review synthesizes recent advances, identifies emerging trends, and outlines potential directions for future research. These insights aim to inform the design of efficient and robust EEG classification architectures capable of meeting the practical demands of real-world BCI applications.",

    "title": "Evaluating the clinical readiness of artificial intelligence in EEG-based epilepsy diagnosis",
    "content": "Objective. Automated electroencephalography (EEG)-based epilepsy diagnosis has reported near-perfect accuracies for almost two decades on a benchmark dataset, yet virtually no system is used in routine care. We critically re-examined this translation gap by reproducing five widely cited Artificial Intelligence (AI) models spanning statistical feature extraction, classical machine-learning and deep-learning paradigms, and assessed their ability to generalise from the benchmark dataset to a newly curated, clinically verified scalp-EEG cohort. Approach. All models were implemented as originally described and trained with ten-fold cross-validation on the benchmark dataset. External validation was performed on our independently curated dataset made publicly available, comprising 30 subjects (15 epilepsy, 15 healthy) recorded with 19-channel scalp EEG under standard clinical protocols. We further examined the influence of subject-level data leakage by contrasting performance when training/testing samples overlapped with those when completely independent patient partitions were enforced. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of ROC (with 95% Confidence Intervals) were the primary metrics. Main results. When transferred unchanged to the external cohort, overall accuracy fell from 94% on the benchmark dataset to 42%\u201353%, with sensitivities as low as 0.97% for the deep convolutional neural network and specificities dropping to 4% for time-frequency methods. Permitting subject overlap artificially elevated accuracy to 59%\u201396%, whereas strict patient separation reduced it to 41%\u201353% in 95% Confidence Interval. Deep-learning models exhibited the steepest decline, confirming over-fitting to subject-specific artefacts. Statistical feature\u2013based approaches, though less affected, still under-performed clinically acceptable thresholds. Significance. Our results expose key translational barriers in AI for EEG-based epilepsy diagnosis\u2013data leakage, acquisition bias, and overfitting to patient idiosyncrasies\u2013leading to severe performance erosion on clinical data. Rigorous patient-independent validation, transparent reporting (aligned with CARE principles), and well-curated multi-channel scalp-EEG datasets are essential to ensure clinically dependable AI tools for epilepsy diagnosis.",

    "title": "Physiological Arousal as a Predominant Source of Individual Differences in Functional Brain Networks",
    "content": "Individual differences in brain network function and organization are promising targets for fMRI-based biomarkers in precision psychiatry, yet the sources of individual variability remain poorly understood. We show that arousal, assessed by systemic low-frequency oscillation (sLFO) amplitude in the fMRI signal, accounts for a substantial portion of variance in brain network properties (e.g.: R= 0.70 for default mode network (DMN)-dorsal attention connectivity; R= -0.63 for DMN dynamics). These relationships replicated across sessions, across independent samples, and when assessed with traditional arousal indices. Critically, associations persisted after sLFO denoising, indicating a genuine brain-physiology relationship rather than hemodynamic artifact. Pharmacological manipulation showed that drug-induced sLFO-assessed arousal changes were accompanied by corresponding shifts in network connectivity and dynamics. This work identifies arousal as a prominent determinant of variability in functional brain networks, providing a new perspective on brain-based individual differences while offering an approach to measure arousal directly from fMRI data.",

    "title": "Distinct neural temporal architectures encode rapid social expressions and sustained internal mood states",
    "content": "Affective processing operates across multiple temporal scales, from rapid social signaling through facial expressions to sustained internal mood states, yet the neural computational principles governing these different timescales remain unclear. Understanding how the brain implements distinct temporal architectures for momentary versus persistent affective phenomena is important to comprehending emotional processing and developing objective biomarkers for psychiatric conditions. Here, we introduced a multimodal approach combining automated facial expression monitoring and continuous intracranial electroencephalography in 2,037 electrode contacts across 16 epilepsy patients, over multiple days. Of these, 15 and 12 patients met criteria for facial expression and for mood analysis, respectively. Among patients meeting criteria, we captured 1,396 naturalistic smiles, and 3,746 neutral expressions, separated by at least 10 seconds, alongside 336 periodic mood assessments. This paradigm revealed distinct behavioral and neural computational architectures. Aperiodic neural activity in the lateral temporal cortex (79.5% accuracy) encoded facial expressions with high cross-participant generalizability. Mood states, however, showed different encoding patterns. Facial expressions provided no consistent mood indicators across participants. Critically, low-gamma power dynamics in limbic regions encoded mood states in only a subset of individuals (5 of 12 participants) with expression-mood behavioral correlations, suggesting a distinct encoding phenotype. Cross-domain analysis confirmed computational independence: neural features optimized for facial expression decoding failed to predict sustained mood states, and vice versa. These findings suggest that multiple neural mechanisms may influence underlying affective processing, with variations in their contributions between individuals. The results provide a framework for understanding individual differences in neural mood representation and establish methodological approaches for objective measurement of naturalistic affective behaviors.",

    "title": "Single-cell perturbations reveal adaptive, stimulus-dependent recurrence in visual cortex",
    "content": "Cortical processing must adapt dynamically to the strength of sensory inputs, integrating information when signals are weak and refining representations when they are strong. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest this adaptation involves recurrent cortical circuits through cooperative amplification and competitive interactions within functional networks. Recent studies in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) have begun to support this idea, consistent with novel circuit motifs whereby excitatory and inhibitory cells are strongly connected. Despite these advancements, neither models or data provide a clear picture of the behavior of cortical columns within circuits with functional topography. Here, neighboring cells (excitatory and inhibitory) are selective for similar features in visual space, raising the question as to whether cortical columns act as amplifiers or engage in feature competition. Moreover, columnar network models make a strong prediction: cortical circuits should engage in functional amplification during weak sensory drive, transitioning to suppressive interactions with increasing sensory drive-a prediction not yet directly tested. Using single-cell perturbations in ferret V1, we show that cortical networks switch between amplification and suppression, depending on stimulus strength. Combining two-photon optogenetic stimulation with a generalized linear model (GLM) to quantify perturbations, we uncovered spatially broad suppressive influence modulated by stimulus contrast. At low contrast, we observed amplification between functionally-coupled cells. At high contrast, these networks switched to suppression. This reversal emerged in a recurrent network model with strong inhibitory-excitatory connectivity and weaker excitatory-excitatory connections. This class of models predicts markedly stronger suppressive influences from inhibitory cells onto excitatory populations, which we confirmed with cell-specific perturbations. Our results show that cortical recurrence with functional topography toggles between amplification and suppression, providing direct evidence long-predicted by normative and mechanistic circuit models of visual cortex.",

    "title": "Cortex-wide Dynamics of Internal Decisions About Behavioral Context",
    "content": "Many human decisions manifest in the outside world as motor actions. Correspondingly, neural signals reflecting decision formation are expressed in neural populations encoding the final action. Some decisions, however, are internal, shaping overt behavior indirectly through the selection of policies or rules that guide elementary sensory-motor decisions. We studied the human brain dynamics underlying internal decisions about the stimulus-response mapping rule for reporting visual orientation judgments. The rule changed unpredictably in a hidden fashion, and participants tracked it by accumulating ambiguous sensory cues. Computational model-based decoding of source-level magnetoencephalography data uncovered representations of the internal belief about the active rule in many areas, including occipital cortex. These representations exhibited profiles as predicted by normative models and as observed in action-related frontal areas during overt decisions. We conclude that a widely distributed network of cortical areas implements evidence accumulation for internal decisions, and that even visual cortex may represent high-level beliefs.",

    "title": "Early Post-Stimulus Activity Negatively Predicts P300 Amplitude: A Single-Trial Analysis of the Auditory Oddball Task",
    "content": "The P300 event-related potential is a core index of attention and context updating, yet the trial-by-trial factors that modulate its amplitude remain incompletely characterized. This study tested whether early post-stimulus signal magnitude in the sensory window (0 150 ms) predicts subsequent P300 amplitude (300 600 ms) at the single-trial level. Using data from the ERP CORE auditory oddball dataset (N = 40 participants; 1,661 accepted trials), early activity was quantified as root mean square (RMS) amplitude at electrode Fz. A linear mixed-effects model revealed a statistically reliable negative association between early RMS and P300 amplitude at Pz ({beta} = -0.064, SE = 0.0245, z = -2.61, p = 0.0085). However, early RMS explained minimal trial-level variance (R2 = 0.0042), indicating a modest effect. Model diagnostics confirmed adequate assumptions for inference (Shapiro-Wilk W = 0.9995, p = 0.9690). Exploratory complexity measures (permutation entropy, Lempel / Ziv) were not predictive. Because RMS reflects both signal magnitude and within-trial variability, the findings are most conservatively interpreted as evidence that higher early signal energy is associated with slightly reduced P300 amplitude, possibly reflecting resource competition, refractory effects, or state-dependent processing. The results provide methodologically rigorous evidence for a small but reliable coupling between early and late ERP components, while highlighting the importance of distinguishing amplitude-based measures from trial-to-trial variability. Independent replication and control analyses separating mean amplitude from dispersion are needed to clarify the underlying mechanism.",

    "content": "Expression recognition relies on the ability to distinguish subtle visual differences across a range of facial expressions. Here, we examine the neural representation of dynamic expressions as reflected by electroencephalography (EEG) data in human adults. We find that a wide range of expressions (i.e., 14 emotional and 10 conversational expressions) can be decoded from neural signals, and that their representational structure evinces the classic dimensions of valence and arousal. Critically, we recover, through EEG-based video reconstruction, dynamic representations whose content succeeds in capturing even fine differences across related expressions (e.g., happy-satiated versus schadenfreude). Further, time-resolved decoding reveals anticipatory dynamics that maximize accuracy before the occurrence of an apex expression in the visual stimulus. These results are validated against behavioral data, which yield static reconstructions consistent with their neural counterparts. Thus, our results shed light on the representational basis of expression recognition and serve to recover the dynamic content of visual experience.",

    "title": "Evidence for an Integrated Bilingual Language System from Discourse Tasks in Aphasia",
    "content": "Background: The extent to which bilingual individuals represent and process their two languages within a shared or partially distinct neural architecture remains a topic of ongoing debate. While both parallel and divergent patterns of impairment have been reported in bilingual aphasia, such findings likely reflect a spectrum of representational overlap influenced by dominance, proficiency, and task demands. Critically, few studies have examined how breakdown manifests across multiple levels of linguistic structure using ecologically valid, discourse-based tasks. Aims: This study investigates whether Spanish-English bilinguals with aphasia exhibit parallel or dissociable patterns of impairment across their two languages, focusing on naturalistic narrative production and fine-grained analysis of error types and code-switching. Methods & Procedures: Thirteen bilingual individuals with aphasia following acquired brain injury produced story retellings in both languages. Speech samples were transcribed and coded for phonological, morphological, syntactic, and semantic errors, and for the word type at which they occurred. Code-switches were also identified and categorized. Analyses included generalized linear modeling and unsupervised clustering. Outcomes & Results: While participants made more errors in their non-dominant language, the structure and distribution of errors were highly similar across languages. Clustering algorithms revealed that impairments were parallel across languages and did not group by language dominance. Code-switching occurred more frequently from the non-dominant to the dominant language, consistent with activation-based lexical selection. Conclusions: Findings support an integrated bilingual language system that spans multiple levels of linguistic representation, modulated by language dominance. Naturalistic discourse tasks allow for richer characterization of bilingual language breakdown and may better inform both theoretical models and clinical management of bilingual aphasia.",

    "title": "Musical training improves planning and robustness of sequence learning",
    "content": "Musicians demonstrate advantages in acquiring motor sequences, showing faster learning and better explicit sequence knowledge than non-musicians. However, it is unclear whether this advantage extends beyond acquisition to the consolidation phase, which is when newly learned skills stabilize and become resistant to interference. Additionally, while interference from executing competing motor tasks is well-established, less is known about whether purely sensory information presented after learning can disrupt consolidation of a bimodal motor sequence. We investigated how post-acquisition sensory interference affects performance of a learned audio-visual sequence, and whether musical training moderates this vulnerability. Participants first learned an explicit sequence in a serial reaction time task using synchronous, informative audio-visual cues. After a brief consolidation period, they were randomly assigned to one of four observational conditions that manipulated the relationship between auditory and visual streams. Motor performance was then reassessed. Post-acquisition sensory interference significantly impaired subsequent motor performance, but this effect was modality-specific: it was driven primarily by manipulations to the task-relevant visual stream, while auditory interference alone had no credible effect. Distributional analysis revealed that learning involved a strategic shift from reactive to anticipatory responding. Critically, participants with musical training made this shift significantly faster than those without, demonstrating a more rapid adoption of predictive motor control. These findings demonstrate that newly formed sensorimotor memories are selectively vulnerable to interference in task-relevant modalities. Furthermore, our work provides a mechanistic explanation for the musician advantage in sequence learning, linking it to faster development of predictive motor strategies during consolidation.",

This study aims to develop a Wudhu learning application based on Augmented Reality (AR) as an interactive and fun educational medium. The development method used includes the stages of needs analysis, system design, implementation, and testing using Black Box Testing. The system utilizes marker-based tracking to display 3D animations of Wudhu movements in real-time when the camera detects a marker on the printed media. The test results indicate that all main functions run well, and a limited trial on children aged 5-7 years showed an increase in learning interest and a better understanding of the Wudhu sequence. Thus, the application of AR technology is proven effective in improving the quality of basic worship instruction for young children.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.17228v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Most digital music tools emphasize precision and control, but often lack support for tactile, improvisational workflows grounded in environmental interaction. Lumia addresses this by enabling users to \"compose through looking\"--transforming visual scenes into musical phrases using a handheld, camera-based interface and large multimodal models. A vision-language model (GPT-4V) analyzes captured imagery to generate structured prompts, which, combined with user-selected instrumentation, guide a text-to-music pipeline (Stable Audio). This real-time process allows users to frame, capture, and layer audio interactively, producing loopable musical segments through embodied interaction. The system supports a co-creative workflow where human intent and model inference shape the musical outcome. By embedding generative AI within a physical device, Lumia bridges perception and composition, introducing a new modality for creative exploration that merges vision, language, and sound. It repositions generative music not as a task of parameter tuning, but as an improvisational practice driven by contextual, sensory engagement.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.17172v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven augmented reality (AR) systems are becoming increasingly integrated into daily life, and with this growth comes a greater need for explainability in real-time user interactions. Traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods, which often rely on feature-based or example-based explanations, struggle to deliver dynamic, context-specific, personalized, and human-centric insights for everyday AR users. These methods typically address separate explainability dimensions (e.g., when, what, how) with different explanation techniques, resulting in unrealistic and fragmented experiences for seamless AR interactions. To address this challenge, we propose PILAR, a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to generate context-aware, personalized explanations, offering a more intuitive and trustworthy experience in real-time AI-powered AR systems. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on multiple techniques for different aspects of explanation, PILAR employs a unified LLM-based approach that dynamically adapts explanations to the user's needs, fostering greater trust and engagement. We implement the PILAR concept in a real-world AR application (e.g., personalized recipe recommendations), an open-source prototype that integrates real-time object detection, recipe recommendation, and LLM-based personalized explanations of the recommended recipes based on users' dietary preferences. We evaluate the effectiveness of PILAR through a user study with 16 participants performing AR-based recipe recommendation tasks, comparing an LLM-based explanation interface to a traditional template-based one. Results show that the LLM-based interface significantly enhances user performance and experience, with participants completing tasks 40% faster and reporting greater satisfaction, ease of use, and perceived transparency.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.17149v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study investigates the task of dwell time prediction and proposes a Transformer framework based on interaction behavior modeling. The method first represents user interaction sequences on the interface by integrating dwell duration, click frequency, scrolling behavior, and contextual features, which are mapped into a unified latent space through embedding and positional encoding. On this basis, a multi-head self-attention mechanism is employed to capture long-range dependencies, while a feed-forward network performs deep nonlinear transformations to model the dynamic patterns of dwell time. Multiple comparative experiments are conducted with BILSTM, DRFormer, FedFormer, and iTransformer as baselines under the same conditions. The results show that the proposed method achieves the best performance in terms of MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and RMAE, and more accurately captures the complex patterns in interaction behavior. In addition, sensitivity experiments are carried out on hyperparameters and environments to examine the impact of the number of attention heads, sequence window length, and device environment on prediction performance, which further demonstrates the robustness and adaptability of the method. Overall, this study provides a new solution for dwell time prediction from both theoretical and methodological perspectives and verifies its effectiveness in multiple aspects.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.17140v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper presents the design and evaluation of a community-based artificial intelligence (AI) workflow developed for the Kaiapuni Assessment of Educational Outcomes (K\\=A'EO) program, the only native language assessment used for federal accountability in the United States. The project explored whether document-grounded language models could ethically and effectively augment human analysis of item performance while preserving the cultural and linguistic integrity of the Hawaiian language. Operating under the K\\=A'EO AI Policy Framework, the workflow used NotebookLM for cross-document synthesis of psychometric data and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for developer-facing interpretation, with human oversight at every stage. Fifty-eight flagged items across Hawaiian Language Arts, Mathematics, and Science were reviewed during Round 2 of the AI Lab, producing six interpretive briefs that identified systemic design issues such as linguistic ambiguity, Depth-of-Knowledge (DOK) misalignment, and structural overload. The findings demonstrate that AI can serve as an ethically bounded amplifier of human expertise, accelerating analysis while simultaneously prioritizing fairness, human expertise, and cultural authority. This work offers a replicable model for responsible AI integration in Indigenous-language educational measurement.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.17117v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Human-AI interactions are increasingly part of everyday life, yet the interpersonal dynamics that unfold during such exchanges remain underexplored. This study investigates how emotional alignment, semantic exploration, and linguistic innovation emerge within a collaborative storytelling paradigm that paired human participants with a large language model (LLM) in a turn-taking setup. Over nine days, more than 3,000 museum visitors contributed to 27 evolving narratives, co-authored with an LLM in a naturalistic, public installation. To isolate the dynamics specific to human involvement, we compared the resulting dataset with a simulated baseline where two LLMs completed the same task. Using sentiment analysis, semantic embeddings, and information-theoretic measures of novelty and resonance, we trace how humans and models co-construct stories over time. Our results reveal that affective alignment is primarily driven by the model, with limited mutual convergence in human-AI interaction. At the same time, human participants explored a broader semantic space and introduced more novel, narratively influential contributions. These patterns were significantly reduced in the simulated AI-AI condition. Together, these findings highlight the unique role of human input in shaping narrative direction and creative divergence in co-authored texts. The methods developed here provide a scalable framework for analysing dyadic interaction and offer a new lens on creativity, emotional dynamics, and semantic coordination in human-AI collaboration.",

    "title": "Virtual Reality in Service Design for Plastics Recycling: Two Application Cases",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.17081v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Plastics recycling depends on everyday sorting practices and on how recycling services are communicated and experienced. Virtual reality (VR) can present these practices and services in situated, interactive form, yet its role in service design for plastics recycling is still emerging. This paper examines how VR tools can contribute to designing plastics recycling services through two application cases that address different stages of the recycling journey. The first case, Clean Cabin Escape, is a household scale VR escape room where players collect and sort waste items into locally relevant categories, with immediate feedback that supports practice with plastics recycling decisions. The second case is a VR simulation of a plastics recycling center that represents a real planned site and is used in service design workshops where stakeholders explore layout, signage and customer paths for plastics fractions. Across the cases, we analyse how VR supported learning, engagement and shared sensemaking, and how it interacted with other service design methods such as workshops, customer path mapping and physical artefacts. The findings show that VR can make domestic sorting tasks and complex recycling centers more concrete for both citizens and professionals, but also highlight trade offs related to hardware access, onboarding effort, visual fidelity and localisation of recycling rules. The paper concludes by outlining opportunities for integrating VR into broader service design toolsets for plastics recycling and circular economy services, and by pointing to directions for future research on long term impact and inclusive design.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.17067v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Social bots are now deeply embedded in online platforms for promotion, persuasion, and manipulation. Most bot-detection systems still treat behavioural features as static, implicitly assuming bots behave stationarily over time. We test that assumption for promotional Twitter bots, analysing change in both individual behavioural signals and the relationships between them. Using 2,615 promotional bot accounts and 2.8M tweets, we build yearly time series for ten content-based meta-features. Augmented Dickey-Fuller and KPSS tests plus linear trends show all ten are non-stationary: nine increase over time, while language diversity declines slightly.\n  Stratifying by activation generation and account age reveals systematic differences: second-generation bots are most active and link-heavy; short-lived bots show intense, repetitive activity with heavy hashtag/URL use; long-lived bots are less active but more linguistically diverse and use emojis more variably. We then analyse co-occurrence across generations using 18 interpretable binary features spanning actions, topic similarity, URLs, hashtags, sentiment, emojis, and media (153 pairs). Chi-square tests indicate almost all pairs are dependent. Spearman correlations shift in strength and sometimes polarity: many links (e.g. multiple hashtags with media; sentiment with URLs) strengthen, while others flip from weakly positive to weakly or moderately negative. Later generations show more structured combinations of cues.\n  Taken together, these studies provide evidence that promotional social bots adapt over time at both the level of individual meta-features and the level of feature interdependencies, with direct implications for the design and evaluation of bot-detection systems trained on historical behavioural features.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.17025v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Although serious games have been increasingly used for mental health applications, few explicitly address coping with grief as a core mechanic and narrative experience for patients. Existing grief-related digital games often focus on clinical training for medical professionals rather than immersive storytelling and agency in emotional processing for the patient. In response, we designed Road to Acceptance, a VR game that presents grief through first-person narrative and gameplay. As the next phase of evaluation, we propose a workshop-based study with 12 licensed mental health professionals to assess the therapeutic impacts of the game and the alignment with best practices in grief education and interventions. This will inform iterative game design and patient evaluation methods, ensuring that the experience is clinically appropriate. Potential findings can contribute to the design principles of grief-related virtual reality experiences, bridging the gap between interactive media, mental health interventions, and immersive storytelling.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.17017v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Working with abstract information often relies on static, symbolic representations that constrain exploration. We introduce Explorable Ideas, a framework that externalizes abstract concepts into explorable environments where physical navigation coordinates conceptual exploration. To investigate its practical value, we designed Idea Islands, a VR probe for ideation tasks, and conducted two controlled studies with 19 participants. Results show that overview perspectives foster strategic breadth while immersion sustains engagement through embodied presence, and that seamless transitions enable flexible workflows combining both modes. These findings validate the framework's design considerations and yield design implications for building future systems that treat information as explorable territory across creative, educational, and knowledge-intensive domains.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.17655v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Computational measurement of human behavior from video has recently become feasible due to major advances in AI. These advances now enable granular and precise quantification of facial expression, head movement, body action, and other behavioral modalities and are increasingly used in psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, and mental health research. However, mainstream adoption remains slow. Most existing methods and software are developed for engineering audiences, require specialized software stacks, and fail to provide behavioral measurements at a level directly useful for hypothesis-driven research. As a result, there is a large barrier to entry for researchers who wish to use modern, AI-based tools in their work. We introduce Bitbox, an open-source toolkit designed to remove this barrier and make advanced computational analysis directly usable by behavioral scientists and clinical researchers. Bitbox is guided by principles of reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability. It provides a standardized interface for extracting high-level behavioral measurements from video, leveraging multiple face, head, and body processors. The core modules have been tested and validated on clinical samples and are designed so that new measures can be added with minimal effort. Bitbox is intended to serve both sides of the translational gap. It gives behavioral researchers access to robust, high-level behavioral metrics without requiring engineering expertise, and it provides computer scientists a practical mechanism for disseminating methods to domains where their impact is most needed. We expect that Bitbox will accelerate integration of computational behavioral measurement into behavioral, clinical, and mental health research. Bitbox has been designed from the beginning as a community-driven effort that will evolve through contributions from both method developers and domain scientists.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.17775v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Working memory is a promising paradigm for assessing cognitive ergonomics of brain states in brain-computer interfaces(BCIs). This study decodes these states with a focus on environmental illumination effects via two distinct working memory tasks(Recall and Sequence) for mixed-recognition analysis. Leveraging nonlinear patterns in brain connectivity, we propose an innovative framework: multi-regional dynamic interplay patterns based on beta phase synchrony dynamics, to identify low-dimensional EEG regions (prefrontal, temporal, parietal) for state recognition. Based on nonlinear phase map analysis of the above three brain regions using beta-phase connectivity, we found that: (1)Temporal-parietal phase clustering outperforms other regional combinations in distinguishing memory states; (2)Illumination-enhanced environments optimize temporoparietal balance;(3) Machine learning confirms temporal-parietal synchrony as the dominant cross-task classification feature. These results provide a precise prediction algorithm, facilitating a low-dimensional system using temporal and parietal EEG channels with practical value for real-time cognitive ergonomics assessment in BCIs and optimized human-machine interaction.",

    "title": "Gravity Prior and Temporal Horizon Shape Interceptive Behavior under Active Inference",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.17735v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Accurate interception of moving objects, such as catching a ball, requires the nervous system to overcome sensory delays, noise, and environmental dynamics. One key challenge is predicting future object motion in the presence of sensory uncertainty and inherent neural processing latencies. Theoretical frameworks such as internal models and optimal control have emphasized the role of predictive mechanisms in motor behavior. Active Inference extends these ideas by positing that perception and action arise from minimizing variational free energy under a generative model of the world. In this study, we investigate how different predictive strategies and the inclusion of environmental dynamics, specifically an internal model of gravity, influence interceptive control within an Active Inference agent. We simulate a simplified ball-catching task in which the agent moves a cursor horizontally to intercept a parabolically falling object. Four strategies are compared: short temporal horizon prediction of the next position or long horizon estimation of the interception point, each with or without a gravity prior. Performance is evaluated across diverse initial conditions using spatial and temporal error, action magnitude, and movement corrections. All strategies produce successful interception behavior, but those that incorporate gravity and longer temporal horizons outperform others. Including a gravity prior significantly improves spatial and temporal accuracy. Predicting the future interception point yields lower action values and smoother trajectories compared to short-horizon prediction. These findings suggest that internal models of physical dynamics and extended predictive horizons can enhance interceptive control, providing a unified computational account of how the brain may integrate sensory uncertainty, physical expectations, and motor planning.",

While this bistable behavior has been already observed in the past, the characterization of the statistical properties of avalanche activity and their temporal organization is still lacking, as well as a model able to reproduce these dynamics. Here, we analyze experimental data of human neuronal cultures with controlled percentage of inhibitory neurons and characterize their statistical properties and dynamical organization. In order to model the experimental data, we propose a novel version of the Kuramoto model for two populations of oscillators, excitatory and inhibitory, implementing successfully the inhibition dynamics. The model can fully reproduce the experimental results, confirming the existence of correlations in the temporal organization of avalanche activity and the presence of an amplification - attenuation regime, as found in the human brain.",

    "title": "From Priors to Predictions: Explaining and Visualizing Human Reasoning in a Graph Neural Network Framework",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.17255v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Humans excel at solving novel reasoning problems from minimal exposure, guided by inductive biases, assumptions about which entities and relationships matter. Yet the computational form of these biases and their neural implementation remain poorly understood. We introduce a framework that combines Graph Theory and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to formalize inductive biases as explicit, manipulable priors over structure and abstraction. Using a human behavioral dataset adapted from the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), we show that differences in graph-based priors can explain individual differences in human solutions. Our method includes an optimization pipeline that searches over graph configurations, varying edge connectivity and node abstraction, and a visualization approach that identifies the computational graph, the subset of nodes and edges most critical to a model's prediction. Systematic ablation reveals how generalization depends on specific prior structures and internal processing, exposing why human like errors emerge from incorrect or incomplete priors. This work provides a principled, interpretable framework for modeling the representational assumptions and computational dynamics underlying generalization, offering new insights into human reasoning and a foundation for more human aligned AI systems.",

    "title": "Build Android apps using Rust and iced",
    "content": "<p>Some time ago I decided to try building an Android app using Rust. After a few weeks I got it working. There was a new iced release recently, so I've just updated the example to new iced and wgpu. I'd like to share my experience to attract more attention to Rust on Android.<p>First things, I want to thank all the people who work on the foundational crates and tools such as:\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/jni-rs/jni-rs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/jni-rs/jni-rs</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit</a>\n- and many others<p>When I started I had to learn what tools and examples already exist. Luckily, there's a good set of examples using both NativeActivity and GameActivity:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-mobile/rust-android-examples\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/rust-mobile/rust-android-examples</a><p>The basic approach is that we take android-activity, winit and wgpu and that's it. On top of that you can find a few egui examples in the rust-android-examples repo.<p>Alright, so after I've got the basic examples running, I wanted to combine them with iced. Iced is a crossplatform gui library focusing on desktop and web. The mobile support is explicitly a non-goal, as far as I can tell at the moment of writing. Yet, there's an issue where some people posted their experiments. That's how I knew it was possible:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/issues/302\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/issues/302</a><p>There's a way to integrate iced in wgpu applications, so called integration example:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/tree/0.14.0/examples/integration\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/tree/0.14.0/examples/integra...</a><p>Above I mentioned that using winit and wgpu in combination with android-activity is enough to build the app. Putting together 1 + 1 I got 2: let's use iced integration example with android-activity. It was quite easy to compile with almost no errors. First issue I encountered is that there was no text rendered. I solved this by loading fonts the way it was shown here:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-text/issues/243#issue-2189977938\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-text/issues/243#issue-21899...</a><p>Then I patched a few widgets to add touch support. And that's it. My role here was to take all the prior work and combine it together in a way that there's a working example.<p>Some other ways of building Android apps using Rust:\n- xilem has an explicit goal to support mobile <a href=\"https://github.com/linebender/xilem\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/linebender/xilem</a>\n- egui supports mobile <a href=\"https://github.com/emilk/egui\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/emilk/egui</a>\n- game engines such as Fyrox and Bevy support mobile:\n  - <a href=\"https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox</a>\n  - <a href=\"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy</a>\n- pretty much anything built on top of winit and wgpu<p>All of the above is related to building native apps using either NativeActivity or GameActivity. I'm leaving webview out of scope of current post.<p>What about iOS? As far as I know it should be similar or maybe simpler compared to Android. I haven't built it yet, but the next time I have a sizeable amount of free time, I'll try to make it work. The plan is the same: pick winit, wgpu, iced integration example, mix it together until it works. It'll require the same trick to load fonts, and maybe something else, but no visible blockers as of now.<p>Once again, thanks to all the people who made it possible and I wish you have a great time building mobile apps with Rust!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46350641\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46350641</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
    "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

    "title": "Effective and efficient self-supervised masked model based on mixed feature training",
    "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

    "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
    "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science (last search: March 2022) selecting all studies that conducted quantitative scientific research on the ASMR phenomenon. Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

    "content": "We experience and express emotions via our bodies, and we are also able to infer the emotional states of others by observing their movements and postures. The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others. Implications for future work on the role of embodiment in social cognition and psychiatric disorders are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Attention and body awareness: The role of inhibition and the management of cognitive resources in the perception of spontaneous sensations.",
    "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

    "title": "Dreaming about pain: Dreams series of a chronic pain patient.",
    "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

Seventeen participants spent three consecutive nights at a sleep laboratory, where awakenings were scheduled to collect dream reports from both REM and NREM sleep. Participants interpreted their dreams using guided questions based on the Hill cognitive-experiential model. External judges evaluated dreamers\u2019 insight and the interpretation process. Results indicated that REM dream reports contained significantly longer and more complex narratives compared to NREM dream reports. Participants did not generate more associations from REM dreams than from NREM dreams; however, they derived more meaningful insight from REM dreams. Additionally, participants were significantly more likely to report gaining inspiration or solving problems through REM dreams than through NREM dreams, with a moderate effect size.

    "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
    "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

    "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

    "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

    "title": "Why motor learning involves multiple systems: an algorithmic perspective",
    "content": "The initial stage of learning motor skills involves exploring vast action spaces, making it impractical to learn the value of every possible action independently. This poses a challenge for standard reinforcement learning approaches, which excel in constrained domains but struggle when the space of possible actions is high-dimensional. Recent work in machine learning has sought to mitigate this problem by combining deep reinforcement learning with a supervised learning system that reduces the complexity of the control policy space by learning low-dimensional embeddings of an action space. Here, we propose that in the mammalian brain, the cortico-cerebellar network learns these low-dimensional action embeddings in a supervised way, while the basal ganglia learn value and policies in this action embedding space using reinforcement learning. We trained this model on reaching tasks and show that, contrary to traditional models of the basal ganglia, it recapitulates features of neural activity whereby similar reaching movements are associated with similar neural activity patterns in the basal ganglia. We also demonstrate a link between learning these low-dimensional action embeddings and both generalisation and the limits of multi-task adaptation in human behavioural studies. Through this framework, we propose a novel computational view of how key motor regions of the brain interact to efficiently learn a new skill.",

    "title": "Excitatory nicotinic signaling drives action potential bursting in dopaminergic axons",
    "content": "Axons of dopamine (DA) neurons express nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) that have been shown to both facilitate and suppress striatal DA release, but the mechanisms underlying these opposing actions are unclear. We combined axonal recordings and calcium imaging approaches to examine the effects of nAChRs on DAergic axon excitability. Activation of nAChRs consistently depolarized DAergic axons and increased the probability of evoking action potentials. Calcium imaging experiments showed that weak or moderate stimulation of striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) activated DAergic axons, while strong stimulation blunted multi-pulse protocols. Axon recordings showed that highly synchronous stimulation of CINs triggered a rapid (~125 Hz) burst of 2-4 action potentials in DAergic axons. Imaging experiments showed that nAChR-evoked axon bursts led to prolonged refractoriness, which was mimicked by direct burst stimulation. Thus, nAChR activation locally enhances excitability of DAergic axons over a range of intensities, including the production of locally generated burst firing and subsequent refractory inhibition.",

    "title": "Dual cholinergic mechanisms for sculpting striatal dopamine in vivo",
    "content": "Striatal dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine constitute a computationally powerful neuromodulatory dyad that orchestrates action selection, motivational vigor, and reward learning. Striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) synapse onto DA axons and stimulate DA release via {beta}2-containing nicotinic receptors ({beta}2-nAChRs), providing a local modulatory channel distinct from midbrain-derived spikes. Yet whether this mechanism operates in vivo and how it contributes to striatal computations, orthogonal to those facilitated by prediction errors encoded in the DA somata, remains unresolved. Using spatiotemporally precise optogenetic stimulation of CINs paired with ultrafast DA imaging in the dorsal striatum, we identify a biphasic mode of CIN-evoked DA release in awake mice. CIN activation evoked an ultra-fast {beta}2-nAChR-dependent DA transient peaking within ~40 ms that requires millimeter-scale CIN synchrony and is systematically obscured by conventional imaging bandwidths or slow DA sensor kinetics. A second, delayed DA elevation peaking at ~180 ms persists despite {beta}2-nAChR blockade and is mediated by muscarinic receptors, - and *-nAChRs, and a non-cholinergic CIN messenger, revealing a previously unrecognized polysynaptic CIN mechanism. Our observations reconcile discrepancies between slice and in vivo studies and show that CINs engage DA release through two mechanistically distinct pathways: (i) an ultra-fast, monosynaptic mode provides a spatially expansive DA signal ideally positioned to reconfigure striatal microcircuits globally, and (ii) a slower, spatially flexible polysynaptic DA mode suited for sustaining ongoing decisions. This dual architecture expands the computational repertoire of striatal DA dynamics in behavioral and cognitive control.",

    "title": "Magnetoencephalography reveals adaptive neural reorganization maintaining lexical-semantic proficiency in healthy aging",
    "content": "Although semantic cognition remains behaviorally stable with age, neuroimaging studies report age-related alterations in response to semantic context. We aimed to reconcile these inconsistent findings by combining behavioral and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures and examined the neural mechanisms underlying lexical-semantic processing in healthy aging. Forty-six Finnish-speaking adults (25 female) across younger (22 - 32 years) and older (62 - 69 years) cohorts performed a semantic congruency judgment task on word pairs. Both age groups performed the task with high accuracy, with older adults responding faster than young. While advancing age was not associated with impaired task performance, MEG revealed neural reorganization in the old compared to young adults. Young participants exhibited the canonical N400 effect in the left temporal cortex 300 - 400 ms post-stimulus, followed by a Late Positive Complex (LPC), whereas older adults showed less pronounced congruency effects, and the activation distribution was shifted toward frontal and bilateral regions. Despite the absence of the canonical N400 effect in older participants, multivariate time-resolved decoding demonstrated that the congruency effect was decodable from the MEG responses in both groups from ~300 ms post-stimulus, indicating preserved sensitivity to congruency with age. Decoding performance correlated with response time, suggesting that increased neural separation between semantic concepts facilitates rapid decision-making. Critically, age groups were distinguishable based on their neural responses 300 - 800 ms post-stimulus, reflecting functional reorganization in older adults. Overall, our findings suggest that healthy aging involves adaptive reconfiguration of neural systems, supported by experience-driven strategies that preserve semantic proficiency despite broader age-related cognitive changes.",

    "title": "Automated estimation of frequency and spatial extent of periodic and rhythmic epileptiform activity from continuous electroencephalography data",
    "content": "Objective. Rhythmic and periodic patterns (RPPs) are harmful brain activity observed on electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of critically ill patients. This work describes automatic methods for detection of the frequency and spatial extent of specific RPPs: lateralized and generalized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA, GRDA) and lateralized and generalized periodic discharges (LPD, GPD). Approach. The frequency and spatial extent of RPPs is estimated using signal processing and rule-based logic. Three algorithm variants based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Hilbert\u2013Huang transforms (HHT) were developed for rhythmic delta activity, and three using derivative and time-based peak detection for periodic discharges. Annotations from three expert neurophysiologists served as the gold standard, and inter-rater reliability (IRR) and mean absolute error (MAE) were used to assess performance. Main results. We evaluated the algorithms on segments with 100% agreement on event classification (n = 389) and on the full cohort of 1087 segments (including disagreements). For the first subset, top algorithms matched or exceeded expert agreement for RPP frequency/spatial extent. RDA1b-FFT, the best algorithm for rhythmic delta activity, showed an expert-algorithm IRR of good to excellent with an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 91% and 96% (MAE 0.13 Hz and 0.26 Hz) frequency, and ICCs of 85% and 66% (MAE 0.19 and 0.09) for spatial extent for LRDA and GRDA. For periodic discharges, PD2a, showed and expert-algorithm IRR ICC of 80% and 61% (MAE 0.41 Hz and 0.15 Hz) for frequency, and ICC 77% and 13% (MAE 0.17 and 0.40) for spatial extent of LPD and GPD. For the full cohort, IRR declined, but expert-algorithm IRR remained comparable or superior to experts. Significance. The presence of RPPs at high frequencies and spatial extent are associated with a higher probability of poor outcomes. The proposed algorithms for estimating frequency and spatial extent of RPPs match expert performance and are a viable tool for large-scale EEG analysis.",

Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

    "title": "The effects of elevated serum lactate on measures of apparent cerebral metabolism and perfusion in the anesthetised rodent brain.",
    "content": "Cerebral metabolism is coupled to perfusion and can be probed using a combination of hyperpolarized carbon-13 MRI and perfusion weighted imaging. It is unknown how alterations in serum lactate affect apparent lactate exchange and pyruvate dehydrogenase flux using hyperpolarized 13C MRI, and so this pre-clinical study was designed to assess the sensitivity of MRI to detect changes in perfusion and apparent metabolism in the anesthetized rodent brain due to sodium lactate administration. Results demonstrated significant differences in cerebral blood flow between the saline and sodium L-lactate administered at 0.5 g/kg (112 {+/-} 5 vs 127 {+/-} 2 mL/100g/min), saline and sodium L-lactate administered at 1 g/kg (112 {+/-} 5 vs 90 {+/-} 5 mL/100g/min), and between sodium L-lactate at 0.5 g/kg and sodium L-lactate at 1 g/kg (127 {+/-} 2 vs 90 {+/-} 5 mL/100g/min). There was excellent reproducibility of cerebral perfusion measurements (ICC > 0.95) between observers, indicating high reliability in these results. There were significant differences in [1-13C] lactate:[1-13C] pyruvate between saline vs 0.5 g/kg (0.22 {+/-} 0.05 vs 0.59 {+/-} 0.15) and saline vs 1 g/kg (0.22 {+/-} 0.05 vs 0.62 {+/-} 0.04), but no significant differences in 13C bicarbonate:[1-13C] pyruvate (p = 0.1). In conclusion, perfusion and [1-13C] lactate:[1-13C] pyruvate are sensitive to changes in serum lactate, but 13C bicarbonate:[1-13C] pyruvate were not. This has implications for brain studies using [1-13C] pyruvate, and understanding the impact of serum lactate on clinical hyperpolarised imaging is needed.",

    "title": "OpenStride: an inexpensive, open-source force plate actometry system for quantification of rodent motor activity and behaviour",
    "content": "Introduction: Force plate actometry (FPA) enables quantitative assessment of rodent motor and behavioural activity. Through tracking centre of mass at high temporal and spatial resolution, FPA can directly quantifying motor performance and various behaviours in the context of operator-independent, naturalistic movement. Previously designed systems have been expensive and non-customisable, and they are no longer commercially available. Methods: We designed OpenStride, an open-source FPA system consisting of both hardware and software. Our system was designed to be able to be constructed with standard tools worldwide at a cost of ~$550 USD, with modifiable hardware files, modular software, and support for both Mac and Windows operating systems. Required tools include 3D printing and acrylic laser cutting. Results: OpenStride reliably tracks position within a 30 x 30 cm2 environment. Based on these positional data, OpenStride currently quantifies tremor, ataxia, distance, velocity, low-mobility bouts, and centre-vs-margin time, with potential to expand to additional analyses. Conclusions: OpenStride is intended to provide a valuable tool for high-throughput, inexpensive study of motor and behavioural function and dysfunction. Software and hardware files will be freely disseminated online via GitHub at the time of final publication to enable others to construct and utilise the OpenStride system.",

    "title": "Theta-mediated conceptual reinstatement in vmPFC precedes perceptual reinstatement in ventral visual cortex during memory recall",
    "content": "When recalling past episodes, different features of an experience, such as conceptual meaning and perceptual detail, are reconstructed and reinstated across distributed cortical regions. However, current models of human memory remain unclear how these feature-specific reinstatements unfold over time, and whether they interact hierarchically during memory retrieval. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and time-resolved encoding-retrieval cross-phase classification analysis, we compared the time course of conceptual and perceptual reinstatement during cued visual recall. Conceptual information decoding in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) preceded perceptual information decoding in the ventral visual cortex (VVC), and the two were expressed in distinct frequency bands: theta (4-8 Hz) for conceptual and gamma (30-40 Hz) for perceptual information. Cross-correlation and spectral Granger causality analyses revealed that during reinstatement conceptual information in vmPFC predicted and directed perceptual information in VVC, with theta-band information flow predominantly from vmPFC to VVC. In addition, bottom-up connectivity from VVC to vmPFC was expressed in the alpha band. These findings suggest that memory retrieval proceeds from abstract conceptual reconstruction to the reinstatement of perceptual details, mediated by theta oscillatory communication between prefrontal and sensory areas. We propose a hierarchical interactive model in which vmPFC initiates conceptual activation through theta-band top-down signals, while VVC provides alpha-band feedback for evaluating reconstructed perceptual details.",

    "title": "Path planning of industrial robots based on the adaptive field cooperative sampling algorithm",
    "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

It uses <a href=\"https://activitywatch.net/\">ActivityWatch</a> (A time tracker) data to detect what you are working on (e.g., coding, gaming) and adjusts your feed to match your goal\u2014promoting productivity when you are working and entertainment when you are relaxing. (If you train it in this way)</p> <p><strong>Goal:</strong> To recommend content based on what you are actually doing (using your previous app history) and aiming for productivity, rather than what seems most interesting.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> developers, self-hosters, and productivity enthusiasts</p> <p><strong>Comparison:</strong> As far as I know, I haven't seen someone else who has built an open-source recommendation that uses your app history to curate a feed, but probably just because I haven't found one. Unlike YouTube, which optimizes for <strong>watch time</strong>, Vrdndi optimizes for your <strong>intent</strong>\u2014aligning your feed with your current context (usually for productivity, if you train it for that)</p> <p><strong>The Stack:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Backend</strong>: Python 3.11-3.12</li> <li><strong>ML Framework</strong>: PyTorch (custom neural network that can train on local app history).</li> <li><strong>Data Source</strong>: ActivityWatch (fetches your app history to understand context) and media data (currently Youtube)</li> <li><strong>Frontend</strong>: NiceGUI (for the web interface) &amp; Streamlit (for data labeling).</li> <li><strong>Database</strong>: SQLite (everything stays <strong>local</strong>).</li> </ul> <p><strong>How does it work:</strong> The system processes saved media data and fetches your current app history from ActivityWatch. The model rates the media based on your current context and saves the feed to the database, which the frontend displays. Since it uses a standard database, you could easily connect your own frontend to the model if you prefer.</p> <p>It\u2019s experimental currently.

    "content": "The spatiotemporal learning rule (STLR) can reproduce synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Analysis of the synaptic weights in the network with the STLR is challenging. Consequently, our previous research only focused on the network's outputs. However, a detailed analysis of the STLR requires focusing on the synaptic weights themselves. To address this issue, we mapped the synaptic weights to a distance space and analyzed the characteristics of the STLR. The results indicate that the synaptic weights form a fractal-like structure in Euclidean distance space. Furthermore, three analytical approaches\u2014multi-dimensional scaling, estimating fractal dimension, and modeling with an iterated function system\u2014demonstrate that the STLR forms a fractal structure in the synaptic weights through fractal coding. These findings contribute to clarifying the learning mechanisms in the hippocampus.",

    "title": "Task-constrained self-initiated attention shifts are indexed by frontal-midline theta ramping",
    "content": "In everyday vision, we often shift attention internally without external cues. These self-initiated attention shifts are fundamental to voluntary behavior but are poorly understood because most studies use cue-based paradigms that predetermine when and where to shift attention. To address this gap, we designed a multi-sequential-choice rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm with identical visual inputs to dissociate internal and external determinants of attention across three voluntary shift types: task-constrained self-initiated, externally instructed, and unconstrained free-viewing. Participants viewed four simultaneous streams of letters and made overt attention shifts among them, while EEG was recorded. We time-locked theta (4\u20137 Hz) and alpha (8\u201312 Hz) oscillations to shift onset and found distinct signatures for each condition. Notably, a frontal-midline theta ramping was observed before self-initiated shifts but not before instructed or free-viewing shifts, suggesting a preparatory buildup of cognitive control specific to internally driven shifts. Concurrently, sustained suppression of posterior alpha occurred before self-initiated shifts. In contrast, instructed and free-viewing shifts showed relatively higher posterior alpha. These findings suggest that internally generated, goal-driven shifts engage an anticipatory frontal control mechanism indexed by theta increase and reduce posterior inhibition, whereas externally cued or unguided shifts do not. By isolating these condition-specific neural dynamics under identical external stimuli, our study identifies a unique oscillatory signature, frontal-midline theta ramping, associated with task-constrained self-initiated attention shifts.",

    "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
    "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

    "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
    "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

    "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
    "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

    "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
    "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

    "title": "Show HN: Chart Preview \u2013 Preview environments for Helm charts on every PR",
    "content": "<p>I\u2019m a software engineer who accidentally became my team\u2019s Kubernetes person \u2014 and eventually the bottleneck for every Helm chart PR.<p>I built Chart Preview so reviewers could see Helm chart changes running without waiting on me.<p>A few years ago, my team needed to implement HA for an existing product, which meant deploying on Kubernetes and OpenShift. I spent months learning Kubernetes, Helm, and the surrounding ecosystem. After that, Kubernetes largely became \u201cmy thing\u201d on the team.<p>We later published public Helm charts for the product, and customers started submitting PRs. Those PRs would often sit for months \u2014 not because the changes were bad, but because testing them meant manually spinning up a Kubernetes cluster, deploying the chart with the proposed changes, running through test scenarios, and coordinating verification with product and QA. Since I was the only one who could reliably set up those environments, everything waited on me.<p>I kept thinking: what if the PR itself showed the changes working? What if reviewers could just click a link and see it deployed?<p>That idea became Chart Preview.<p>Chart Preview deploys your Helm chart to a real Kubernetes cluster when you open a PR, provides a unique preview URL for that PR, and cleans everything up automatically when the PR closes.<p>I started by solving a problem I was personally hitting, rather than surveying the whole market upfront. As I built more of it, I looked at existing preview tools and noticed that while there are solid solutions for previewing container-based applications, Helm-specific workflows introduce different challenges \u2014 chart dependencies, layered values files, and opinionated chart structures. That pushed me to focus Chart Preview on being Helm-native first, rather than adapting a container preview workflow to fit Helm.<p>Under the hood, it\u2019s built in Go using the Helm v3 SDK. The architecture is an API server with workers pulling jobs from a PostgreSQL queue \u2014 no Kubernetes operator, just services talking directly to the Kubernetes API. Each preview runs in its own namespace with deny-all NetworkPolicies, ResourceQuotas, and LimitRanges. GitHub integration is done via a GitHub App for check runs and webhooks, with GitLab supported via the REST API.<p>There were a few interesting challenges along the way. Injecting preview hostnames into Ingress resources without corrupting manifests took several iterations. Helm uninstall doesn\u2019t always clean everything up, so deleting the entire namespace turned out to be the safest fallback. Handling rapid pushes to the same PR required build numbering so the latest push always wins. And while the Helm SDK is powerful, it\u2019s under-documented \u2014 I spent a lot of time reading Helm\u2019s source code.<p>I\u2019ve been building and testing this for a few months using real charts like Grafana, podinfo, and WordPress to validate the workflow. It\u2019s early, but it works, and now I\u2019m trying to understand whether other teams have the same pain point I did.<p>You can try it by installing the GitHub App here:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/apps/chart-preview\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/apps/chart-preview</a><p>I\u2019d love feedback on a few things:<p>Does this solve a real problem for your team, or is shared staging \u201cgood enough\u201d?<p>What\u2019s missing that would make you actually use it?<p>Are there Helm charts this wouldn\u2019t work for? (Cluster-scoped resources are intentionally blocked.)<p>Happy to answer questions about the implementation.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46337764\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46337764</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "title": "[Project] Pyrium \u2013 A Server-Side Meta-Loader & VM: Script your server in Python",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I wanted to share a project I\u2019ve been developing called <strong>Pyrium</strong>. It\u2019s a server-side meta-loader designed to bring the ease of Python to Minecraft server modding, but with a focus on performance and safety that you usually don't see in scripting solutions.</p> <h1>\ud83d\ude80 &quot;Wait, isn't Python slow?&quot;</h1> <p>That\u2019s the first question everyone asks. Pyrium does <strong>not</strong> run a slow CPython interpreter inside your server. Instead, it uses a custom <strong>Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compiler</strong> that translates Python code into a specialized instruction set called <strong>PyBC (Pyrium Bytecode)</strong>.</p> <p>This bytecode is then executed by a highly optimized, Java-based <strong>Virtual Machine</strong> running inside the JVM. This means you get Python\u2019s clean syntax but with execution speeds much closer to native Java/Lua, without the overhead of heavy inter-process communication.</p> <h1>\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Why use a VM-based approach?</h1> <p>Most server-side scripts (like Skript or Denizen) or raw Java mods can bring down your entire server if they hit an infinite loop or a memory leak.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Sandboxing:</strong> Every Pyrium mod runs in its own isolated VM instance.</li> <li><strong>Determinism:</strong> The VM can monitor instruction counts. If a mod starts &quot;misbehaving,&quot; the VM can halt it without affecting the main server thread.</li> <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Mods are isolated from the JVM and each other.</li> </ul> <h1>\ud83c\udfa8 Automatic Asset Management (The ResourcePackBuilder)</h1> <p>One of the biggest pains in server-side modding is managing textures. Pyrium includes a <a href=\"http://ResourcePackBuilder.java\"><strong>ResourcePackBuilder.java</strong></a> that:</p> <ol> <li>Scans your mod folders for <code>/assets</code>.</li> <li>Automatically handles <strong>namespacing</strong> (e.g., <code>pyrium:my_mod/textures/...</code>).</li> <li>Merges everything into a single ZIP and handles delivery to the clients. No manual ZIP-mashing required.</li> </ol> <h1>\u2699\ufe0f Orchestration via JSON</h1> <p>You don\u2019t have to mess with shell scripts to manage your server versions. Your <code>mc_version.json</code> defines everything:</p> <p>JSON</p> <pre><code>{ &quot;base_loader&quot;: &quot;paper&quot;, // or forge, fabric, vanilla &quot;source&quot;: &quot;mojang&quot;, &quot;auto_update&quot;: true, &quot;resource_pack_policy&quot;: &quot;lock&quot; } </code></pre> <p>Pyrium acts as a manager, pulling the right artifacts and keeping them updated.</p> <h1>\ud83d\udcbb Example: Simple Event Logic</h1> <p>Python</p> <pre><code>def on_player_join(player): broadcast(f&quot;Welcome {player} to the server!&quot;) give_item(player, &quot;minecraft:bread&quot;, 5) def on_block_break(player, block, pos): if block == &quot;minecraft:diamond_ore&quot;: log(f&quot;Alert: {player} found diamonds at {pos}&quot;) </code></pre> <h1>Current Status</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Phase:</strong> Pre-Alpha / Experimental.</li> <li><strong>Instruction Set:</strong> ~200 OpCodes implemented (World, Entities, NBT, Scoreboards).</li> <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Works with Vanilla, Paper, Fabric, and Forge.</li> </ul> <p>I built this because I wanted a way to add custom server logic in seconds without setting up a full Java IDE or worrying about a single typo crashing my 20-player lobby.</p> <p><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/CrimsonDemon567/Pyrium/\">https://github.com/CrimsonDemon567/Pyrium/</a> </p> <p><strong>Pyrium Website:</strong> <a href=\"https://pyrium.gamer.gd\">https://pyrium.gamer.gd</a></p> <p><strong>Mod Author Guide:</strong> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR-EkS9n32URj-EjV31eqU-bks91oviIaizPN57kJm9uFE1kqo2O9hWEl9FdiXTtfpBt-zEPxwA20R8/pub\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR-EkS9n32URj-EjV31eqU-bks91oviIaizPN57kJm9uFE1kqo2O9hWEl9FdiXTtfpBt-zEPxwA20R8/pub</a></p> <p>I'd love to hear some feedback from fellow admins\u2014especially regarding the VM-sandbox approach for custom mini-games or event logic.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dry_Philosophy_6825\"> /u/Dry_Philosophy_6825 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1prasf0/project_pyrium_a_serverside_metaloader_vm_script/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1prasf0/project_pyrium_a_serverside_metaloader_vm_script/\">[comments]</a></span>",

If you only want to change one line or a local variable, you usually have to copy-paste the whole function, which breaks compatibility. UML injects only the necessary logic into the existing AST.</li> <li><strong>VS Other Languages:</strong> This brings the <strong>&quot;Mixin&quot; (Java/Minecraft)</strong> or <strong>&quot;Harmony&quot; (C#/Unity)</strong> style of modding to Python, which has been largely missing in the ecosystem.</li> </ul> <p><strong>The &quot;Magic&quot; (Example)</strong></p> <p>Let's say you have a function with <strong>a local value that is impossible to control from the outside</strong>:</p> <pre><code># target.py import random def attack(self): # The dice roll happens INSIDE the function. # Standard decorators cannot touch this local 'roll' variable. roll = random.randint(1, 100) if roll == 100: print(&quot;Critical Hit!&quot;) else: print(&quot;Miss...&quot;) </code></pre> <p>With my loader, you can intercept the <code>randint</code> call and <strong>force its return value to 100</strong>, guaranteeing a Critical Hit:</p> <pre><code># mods/your_mod.py import universal_modloader as uml # Hook AFTER 'randint' is called, but BEFORE the 'if' check @uml.Inject(&quot;target&quot;, &quot;attack&quot;, at=uml.At.INVOKE(&quot;randint&quot;, shift=uml.Shift.AFTER)) def force_luck(ctx): # Overwrite the return value of randint() ctx['__return__'] = 100 </code></pre> <p><strong>What else can it do?</strong></p> <p>I've included several examples in the repository:</p> <ul> <li><strong>FastAPI (Security)</strong>: Dumping plaintext passwords and bypassing authentication.</li> <li><strong>Tkinter (GUI)</strong>: Modernizing legacy apps with theme injection and widget overlays.</li> <li><strong>Pandas (Data Engineering)</strong>: Injecting progress bars and timers without adding dependencies.</li> <li><strong>CLI Games</strong>: Implementing &quot;God Mode&quot; and &quot;Speedhacks&quot;.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Zero Setup</strong></p> <p>No <code>pip install</code> required for the target.

Every time it ended the same way: frameworks felt heavy and awkward, like Electron felt exrteamly overkill. Even when things worked, apps were big and startup was slow (most of them). so I started experimenting with a different approach and created my own, I tried to focus on performance and on making the developer experience as simple as possible. It's a desktop framework that lets you build fast native apps using Python as a backend (with optional React/Vite, python or just html/js/css for the UI)</p> <p>I\u2019m actively collecting early feedback.

It converts latitude\u2013longitude coordinates into the correct administrative region (country, state, district) without using external APIs, avoiding costs, rate limits, and network dependency.</p> <h4>Comparison with existing alternatives</h4> <p>Most offline reverse geocoders rely only on nearest-neighbor searches and can fail near borders. This project validates actual polygon containment, prioritizing correctness over proximity.</p> <h4>How it works</h4> <p>A KD-Tree is used to quickly shortlist nearby administrative boundaries, followed by on-the-fly polygon enclosure validation. It supports both single-process and multiprocessing modes for small and large datasets.</p> <h4>Performance</h4> <p>Processes 10,000 coordinates in under 2 seconds, with an average validation time below 0.4 ms.</p> <h3>Target audience</h3> <p>Anyone who needs to do geocoding</p> <h3>Implementation</h3> <p>It was started as a toy implementation, turns out to be good on production too</p> <p>The dataset covers 210+ countries with over 145,000 administrative boundaries.</p> <p>Source code: <a href=\"https://github.com/SOORAJTS2001/gazetteer\">https://github.com/SOORAJTS2001/gazetteer</a> Docs: <a href=\"https://gazetteer.readthedocs.io/en/stable\">https://gazetteer.readthedocs.io/en/stable</a> Feedback is welcome, especially on the given approach and edge cases</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sweaty-Strawberry799\"> /u/Sweaty-Strawberry799 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pr3bih/the_offline_geocoder_we_all_wanted/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pr3bih/the_offline_geocoder_we_all_wanted/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "DGAT1-dependent lipid droplet synthesis in microglia attenuates neuroinflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharides.",
    "content": "Lipid droplets (LD) are dynamic storage organelles for triglycerides (TG). LD act as a hub that modulates the availability of fatty acids to sustain metabolic needs and the generation of fatty-acid derived signals. Recent evidence demonstrates that LD metabolism regulates immune responses including in microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system. We have previously shown that blocking LD lipolysis in microglia reduces acute pro-inflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) including cytokine and prostanoid synthesis. Here, we investigated the role of diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), a key enzyme catalyzing the final step of TG synthesis, in microglial LD biogenesis and inflammatory responses induced by LPS. We found that treatment with LPS downregulates specific enzymes in the TG synthesis pathway in primary microglia, including GPAT1, AGPAT3, AGPAT5, and DGAT1, while upregulating TMEM68, a non-canonical TG synthesizing enzyme. Pharmacological inhibition of DGAT1 significantly reduced LD formation in both oleate- and LPS-stimulated conditions, indicating that DGAT1 is essential for inflammation-induced LD synthesis. Moreover, DGAT1 inhibition selectively decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-1{beta}, without affecting IL-6, CCL2, or the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-{beta}. These findings show, that DGAT1-dependent LD formation acts as an important modulator of microglial inflammatory signaling.",

    "title": "Assessing the eligibility of Brainomix e-ASPECTS for acute stroke imaging",
    "content": "BackgroundTimely and accurate assessment of acute ischemic stroke is crucial for determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a widely used tool for evaluating early ischemic changes on non-contrast CT (NCCT), but its interpretation is subject to interobserver variability. Brainomix e-ASPECTS is an automated software designed to standardize and expedite this assessment. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility and diagnostic performance of the Brainomix e-ASPECTS software in an unselected, real-world cohort of patients undergoing NCCT for suspected acute ischemic stroke.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 1,029 NCCT studies from 954 patients between March 2020 and December 2024. e-ASPECTS scores were compared to radiologist-assigned ASPECTS, which served as the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and correlation between scoring methods were assessed.ResultsThere was a strong correlation between e-ASPECTS and radiologist ASPECTS (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.953, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). For detecting acute ischemia, sensitivity was 95.8% (95% CI, 93.6\u201397.3%), specificity 96.9% (95% CI, 94.7\u201398.2%), and overall accuracy 96.3% (95% CI, 95.1\u201397.5%). The positive predictive value was 97.2% (95% CI, 95.3\u201398.4%), and the negative predictive value was 95.3% (95% CI, 92.8\u201396.9%). Score concordance was high, with exact matches in 92.3% of cases and a\u202f\u2264\u202f1-point difference in 97.7%. Misclassification for thrombectomy eligibility (ASPECTS < 6) occurred in four cases (0.4%). The software achieved a processing success rate of 91.9%.ConclusionE-ASPECTS demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with expert radiological assessment, supporting its role as a valuable decision support tool in acute stroke imaging. However, its use should complement, not replace, expert interpretation, particularly in patients with low ASPECTS scores, where treatment decisions are most sensitive.",

    "title": "In vitro reconstitution of hippocampal cell assemblies",
    "content": "Three-dimensional neuronal cultures, such as brain organoids, have proven effective for in vitro modeling of brain development and disease. However, it remains unclear whether these systems can intrinsically generate the spatiotemporal network motifs that support cognitive function, particularly given their lack of sensory input. To address this, we developed a 3D long-range modular neuronal network approach to test whether dissociated embryonic hippocampal cells can self-organize into neuronal manifolds capable of generating network dynamics analogous to the in vivo hippocampal cell assemblies implicated in cognitive function. Using all-optical interrogation, we demonstrate in vitro recapitulation of cell assemblies and their hallmark features, including recurring sequential activation, hierarchical chaining, multi-day stability, resilience to perturbation, and attractor-like pattern completion. We further investigated the effects of acute ketamine exposure on these assemblies, revealing network-wide reconfiguration reminiscent of in vivo responses. Finally, we show that human iPSC-derived neurons can similarly self-organize into modular network architectures. Together, these findings are consistent with an intrinsically inside-out view of the brain, rather than a tabula rasa model in which sensory input is required for the emergence of cognitive network motifs, and open new avenues for in vitro modeling of network-level mechanisms relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "title": "Monolinguals outperform bilinguals in language but not executive function in aging and cognitive impairment.",
    "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Myelin maintenance and addition regulate synaptic plasticity in the adult mouse cortex",
    "content": "Myelination of the developing central nervous system (CNS) increases action potential conduction velocity but can also act as a plasticity brake, limiting neurite reorganisation and synaptic plasticity. As myelination is a life-long process, the myelin laid down in development or adulthood could also affect synapse number or plasticity across the lifespan. We report that conditionally deleting the transcription factor, myelin regulatory factor (Myrf), to disrupt the myelin maintenance program in oligodendrocytes (OLs) from P57 (Plp-CreERT2 :: Myrf fl/fl mice), led to significant myelin loss and impaired action potential conduction and gross motor performance. By sparsely labelling layer V pyramidal neurons in the primary motor cortex, we could visualise the apical and basal dendrites and their excitatory post-synaptic dendritic spines and determined that spine density was normal in P57+60 Plp-CreERT2 :: Myrf fl/fl mice. However, a higher proportion of the dendritic spines were large, stable mushroom spines and generated larger amplitude miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents. These data indicate that the myelin maintenance program is critical for preserving neuron adaptability, homeostasis and glutamate sensitivity. When we instead prevented the addition of new OLs and myelin from P57, action potential conduction velocity and gross motor performance appeared normal. Spine density was also normal in Pdgfr-CreERTM :: Myrf fl/fl mice, however, spine morphology was changed along the basal dendrites of layer V M1 pyramidal neurons. At P117, the basal dendrites were frozen in a state that resembled P57 dendrites, as they retained a higher proportion of thin, plastic spines. These data suggest that adult myelination supports the life-long accumulation of stable spines within the basal but not apical dendritic compartment and have important implications for understanding dendritic plasticity rules in the motor circuit.",

    "title": "Languages of the brain: fMRI dissection of the amodal networks for language, mathematics, and social knowledge",
    "content": "The ability to compose complex mental representations by recombining simpler primitives is a characteristic of the human brain that manifests itself in a variety of domains such as spoken or written language, mathematics, or social reasoning. While it is known that these domains rest on partially distinct brain networks, they are rarely investigated together in the same paradigm. Here, we present a systematic functional MRI study of written and spoken word and sentence processing in each of these domains. In a true-false judgment task, adult participants were presented with a hierarchy of meaningless and meaningful stimuli bearing on various domains of general semantic knowledge and mathematics. The results show that distinct brain regions are activated by (1) syntax and semantics; (2) math versus non-math knowledge; (3) different domains of mathematics, such as geometry versus arithmetic; (4) social knowledge versus other knowledge. All of these regions are activated essentially identically in the written and spoken modalities. The results were replicated in a group of adolescents. Our experiments show that the human brain comprises distinct amodal networks for various domains of linguistic and semantic knowledge, and provide a simple paradigm to dissect them within a short fMRI session.",

    "content": "Salient sensory stimuli are known to evoke neural activations across distributed brain regions. However, the temporal dynamics of these responses over sub-second timescales remain poorly understood, in part due to limitations in the temporal resolution of non-invasive neuroimaging methods. We examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural activations evoked by salient sensory stimuli (rare sounds) using 1,194 widely distributed intracranial electrodes in 5 neurosurgical patients. Salient stimuli preferentially activated 263 of 1,194 electrodes (22%), with responses segregating into two largely distinct spatiotemporal patterns: (1) phasic activation in sensorimotor regions, and (2) sustained activation within the salience network. Cross-correlation analysis revealed that phasic sensorimotor activation preceded sustained salience network activation on a trial-by-trial basis. These findings support an updated view of salience processing in the human brain, revealing that salient stimuli evoke two sequential stages of neural activation - phasic sensorimotor responses followed by sustained salience network activity - rather than simultaneous widespread activation.",

    "content": "BRD1 is an epigenetic regulator implicated in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, yet its role in human neuronal differentiation, maturation, and function remains poorly understood. Here we show that BRD1 haploinsufficiency disrupts early neuronal programming, resulting in accelerated maturation and altered neurodevelopmental trajectories in human induced glutamatergic neurons. Transcriptomic profiling reveals an early shift toward neuronal identity, characterized by downregulation of pluripotency markers and persistent upregulation of genes involved in synapse assembly and organization, including GRIA3. Despite this, BRD1+/- neurons form significantly smaller synapses and display increased neuronal activity. Our findings highlight BRD1 as a key regulator of neurodevelopmental timing and synaptic maturation, and network activity reinforcing growing evidence that disruptions in chromatin-mediated control of differentiation and synaptic organization contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "content": "The social behavior neural network (SBNN) is a circuit composed of reciprocally connected limbic structures that regulate a range of social behaviors, including aggression. Although both males and females of many species display aggressive behavior, studies of the neural circuitry underlying aggression have focused almost exclusively on males. In the present study, we investigated sex differences in neuronal activation of the neural circuitry controlling aggression in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). We employed c-Fos immunohistochemistry to quantify neuronal activation following aggressive encounters between same-sex male and female dyads. Animals were tested in their home cage either alone (n=7 per sex) or with a same-sex, non-aggressive intruder (n=7 per sex) for 10 minutes. Our data revealed substantial sex differences in the neuronal activation of the SBNN following aggression. In some regions, neuronal activity changed in opposite directions in males and females compared to controls (e.g., posterior lateral septum), while in others, there was a change in neuronal activation in only one sex (e.g., medial amygdala). These findings support the hypothesis that the neural circuitry regulating aggression exhibits marked sexual differentiation.",

    "title": "Dynamic Reversal of IT-PFC Information Flow Orchestrates Visual Categorization Under Perceptual Uncertainty",
    "content": "Categorization relies on a dynamic interplay between sensory representation and cognitive control, yet the classical view posits a fixed, feed-forward (FF) information flow from Inferotemporal (IT) to Prefrontal Cortex (PFC). Whether and how this hierarchical directionality adapts to cognitive context, such as perceptual certainty, remains a fundamental question. We investigated this question in monkeys performing a complex delayed match-to-category task using intracranial recording and a novel connectivity analysis: Model-Based Representational Connectivity Analysis (RCA). This approach allowed us to simultaneously track the content, timing, and directionality of information flow between IT and PFC, while controlling for common task-general representations. Our Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) revealed that while both areas rapidly encoded the task-relevant information, IT coding was earlier and transient, whereas PFC exhibited stronger, sustained coding and content-specific recurrence during the memory delay, reflecting active maintenance of the category rule. Crucially, the directionality of information flow was highly modulated by stimulus certainty. For high-certainty stimuli (Far from the category boundary), we observed the classical, predicted feed-forward flow (IT -> PFC). However, for low-certainty stimuli (Close to the category boundary), this hierarchy dynamically reversed, with a dominant, early feedback (FB) flow (PFC -> IT), preceding the feed-forward sweep. This FB signal carried information related to the ambiguous stimuli, suggesting a top-down mechanism to enhance sensory representations. These results challenge fixed-hierarchy models of categorization, providing mechanistic evidence that the brain dynamically reconfigures the direction of information flow between sensory and executive areas as a function of perceptual difficulty. We propose that the PFC initiates a top-down biasing signal to IT when sensory evidence is ambiguous, thus serving as an adaptive, context-driven control mechanism.",

    "title": "End-stage kidney disease patients exhibited slower responses to rapidly presented visual stimuli when compared with healthy controls.",
    "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Validation of immersive virtual reality line and baguette bisection tasks for the assessment of unilateral spatial neglect.",
    "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

    "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

    "content": "The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a measure of the neurophysiological response to sound, widely used in clinical and research settings. In this manuscript, we describe an open-source and low-cost system suitable for measuring the ABR in mice. (This system is not evaluated or approved for clinical use in humans.) The heart of the system is the commercially available Texas Instruments ADS1299 chip, which is designed for multi-channel differential recording of biosignals. We designed auxiliary hardware and software to record and visualize the ABR. To demonstrate that this system is capable of high-quality and low-noise measurements, we recorded the response to free-field auditory clicks from the left and right. Next, we compared different electrode configurations, quantified the most consistent aspects of the ABR, and assessed variability within and across mice. Finally, we demonstrated how to detect the decreased auditory sensitivity caused by surgically induced conductive hearing loss. Users can deploy this open-source system at low cost and customize it for different applications, such as recording other biosignals like electromyography (EMG) or electrocardiography (ECG).",

    "content": "Early life adversity is a major risk factor for mental disorders later in life. Genetic and individual differences modulate the impact of early life trauma and stress on adult mental health, emphasizing the importance of understanding how the early onset of individual differences may shape behavioral outcomes across life. In rodents, genetic differences can be studied using inbred rodent strains or substrains. While C57BL/6 mouse substrains differ in their adult fear behavior, it is unclear when in development these differences emerge. Here we compared the ontogenesis of remote auditory fear retrieval, spontaneous recovery and renewal in the mouse C57BL/6J (Jax, from Jackson Laboratories) and C57BL/6NTac (Taconic Biosciences) substrains spanning postnatal days (P)16, P18, P21, P25 and P30. Taconic male and female mice show an earlier onset of persistent auditory fear memory and spontaneous recovery (females only) compared to Jax mice. Male Taconic mice also display earlier onset of renewal compared to Jax males. These data identify ontogenetic differences in fear processing among C57BL/6 mouse substrains, highlighting how individual differences can contribute to altered behavioral phenotypes in early development.",

    "title": "Excellent agreement between automated deep learning-based and manual DWI infarct volume measurement in hyperacute stroke",
    "content": "Background: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion volume and infarct growth are important imaging markers in acute ischemic stroke, but manual volume measurement is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Deep learning (DL)-based automated segmentation may facilitate rapid assessment; however, its performance on hyperacute DWI has not been sufficiently assessed. The aim was to evaluate the agreement between DL-based automated and manual infarct volume measurements and to compare their ability to predict clinical outcomes in patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Method: Consecutive MT-treated patients (September 2014-December 2019) who underwent DWI at admission and at approximately 24 hours were retrospectively analyzed. Manual infarct volume was measured by stroke neurologists. Automated measurements were obtained using DL-based software. Agreement was assessed using Pearson?s correlation, Bland-Altman analysis, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC 2,1). Inter- and intra-rater reliabilities were evaluated in a randomly selected subgroup of 150 patients. Predictive ability for a good outcome at 3 months (modified Rankin Scale score 0?2 or stable/improved from premorbid status) was compared using C-statistics and DeLong's test. Results: A total of 371 patients (677 DWI scans) were included. Manual and automated measurements showed very strong correlation (r = 0.96) with minimal bias (?1.77 mL). The ICC for manual-automated agreement was 0.959 (95% CI, 0.952-0.965), comparable to inter- and intra-rater ICCs. Agreement remained high across onset-to-imaging times and lesion sizes. Predictive abilities for a good outcome were similar for manual and automated admission DWI volume (C-statistics 0.867 vs. 0.861) and infarct growth (0.859 vs. 0.853). Manual follow-up DWI volume showed slightly better predictive ability than automated measurement (0.880 vs. 0.866). Conclusion: DL-based automated infarct volume measurement shows excellent agreement with experienced clinicians, with predictive performance comparable to manual assessment. Automated DWI-based quantification is reliable and feasible for use in hyperacute stroke management.",

    "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
    "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "title": "Retrieval-related eye movements are predictive of memory precision",
    "content": "Eye movements are predictive of successful episodic memory encoding and retrieval, but it is unclear whether they reflect the precision of retrieved memory content. Here, we examined relationships between eye fixations, memory precision and fMRI BOLD activity. At study, participants were presented with object images, each placed at a random location on an invisible circle. At test, both studied and new images were presented. Participants were instructed to make a covert recognition memory judgment to each image, recall and then signal its studied location, guessing if necessary. Simultaneous fMRI and eye-tracking data were acquired during the test phase. For correctly recognized images, the trial-wise angular distance between the studied and reported locations was fitted to a two-component mixture model. Based on the model-derived parameters, correctly recognized images were categorized as those associated with successful location retrieval (location hits) or guesses. Location hits were further divided into high- and low precision trials. At retrieval, fixations predicted both successful retrieval and the precision of the retrieved location memory. Additionally, across-trial fixation patterns were more similar for location hits than for guesses, and for high- than for low-precision trials. The association between retrieval success and eye fixation precision was evident across almost the entire recall phase, whereas memory precision effects emerged around 1-1.5s after image onset. Fixation precision and fixation pattern similarity each predicted trial-wise memory precision independently of hippocampal BOLD activity, which also predicted precision. These findings suggest that eye fixations during retrieval track the fidelity of mnemonic content.",

    "title": "Gelatinase activity is required for Muller glia morphogenesis and neuronal maintenance in the retina",
    "content": "Glial cells are indispensable support elements of the nervous system, yet the mechanisms by which they integrate into densely packed, extracellular matrix (ECM)-rich environments remain poorly understood. In the retina, Muller glia (MG) serve as the principal support cells, performing roles analogous to astrocytes in the brain. As late-born retinal cells, MG undergo morphogenesis within a complex extracellular milieu composed of neighbouring neurons, synapses, and ECM components. Using the zebrafish retina, we show that developing MG dynamically interact with the ECM across all retinal layers while expressing the ECM-remodelling enzymes matrix metalloproteinases (Mmp) 2 and 9. Although Mmps are known to contribute to tissue remodelling and disease processes such as glioma invasion, their developmental roles in glia remain less defined. Here, we demonstrate that Mmp2 and Mmp9 are required for MG morphogenesis and glia-neuron integration. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic loss of mmp2 and mmp9 impaired MG outgrowth and reduced process complexity within synaptic layers, leading to decreased MG-synapse associations. Double mutants (mmp2-/-;mmp9-/-) displayed normal neuronal development and visual function at larval stages but exhibited gliosis, premature neurodegeneration, and visual deficits in adulthood. Together, these findings reveal that Mmp2 and Mmp9 are critical for establishing MG-synapse interactions during development and for maintaining neuronal integrity and visual function in the mature retina.",

    "content": "Mitochondrial homeostasis is maintained through mitochondrial autophagy, a process commonly known as mitophagy. Recent research has begun to highlight the region- and cell type-specific nature of mitophagy during brain aging; however, these dynamics have largely remained unexplored in living brains. To address this gap, we conducted two-photon mt-Keima imaging in somatosensory cortical neurons and astrocytes in behaving mice across two age groups. Our observations revealed a reduction in mitophagy levels in both cell types during aging, and we consistently found a higher level of mitophagy in astrocytes compared to neurons across both age groups, indicating a cell type-specific mitophagy dynamics that is independently of the aging process. NAD+ augmentation improved mitophagy level in both neurons and astrocytes in old-aged mice at the dose and method of administration tested. Collectively, our data underscore the critical importance of both neuronal and astrocytic metabolic roles in brain aging. The findings also suggest that NAD+ repletion has clinical value in potentially improving these cell type-specific mitophagy dynamics during aging.",

    "title": "PPAR\u03b4 activation in microglia drives a transcriptional response that primes phagocytic function while countering inflammatory activation",
    "content": "Microglia have been implicated in neurodegeneration, though their role remains unclear, as microglia can perform protective functions or promote neuroinflammation. Numerous studies have found that the transcriptome state of microglia can indicate where they lie along this continuum. To understand regulation of microglia transcriptome state, we considered the transcription factor PPAR{delta}, because it is highly expressed in microglia and is a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease, (AD) a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss where microglia dysfunction is involved. When we delineated the microglia transcriptome in mice treated with PPAR{delta} agonist, we noted that PPAR{delta} activation blunted expression of inflammatory mediators and migration-enhancing genes, while boosting phagocytic genes. We then examined PPAR{delta} function in induced transcription factor (iTF) microglia-like cells, and confirmed PPAR{delta} agonism increases phagocyte function while reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and migration. To understand PPAR{delta} regulation upon CNS insult, we exposed iTF-microglia to apoptotic neuron debris and defined six microglia transcriptome states as a function of PPAR{delta} activation, and observed PPAR{delta} agonism can shift microglia out of a homeostatic state to a primed, disease-associated microglia-like state. As PPAR{delta} agonism opposed gene expression favored by PU.1, a critical transcription factor in microglial inflammation and AD pathogenesis, we examined their relationship, documented a physical interaction, and found evidence for transrepression. Finally, we tested PPAR{delta} agonism in Huntington's disease and tauopathy mice, and demonstrated PPAR{delta} could decrease neuroinflammation in vivo. These findings suggest that PPAR{delta} agonist therapy may mitigate microglial dysfunction by restoring beneficial functions, while suppressing detrimental inflammation.",

    "content": "-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission, and their subunit composition (GluA1-4) critically shapes synaptic strength and plasticity. Discriminating AMPAR subtypes at the molecular level remains challenging with conventional techniques. Here, we applied Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) combined with fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to resolve subtype-specific AMPAR assemblies. Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and HALO domain were genetically introduced into GluA1-3 subunits to make intrareceptor FRET pairs. Self-labeling protein (SLP) domains such as SNAP and HALO were used with cell-impermeable substrates to selectively label surface-expressed receptors. This approach identified di-heterotetrameric GluA1/2 and GluA2/3 assemblies at the HEK293T cell membrane, whereas GluA1/3 failed to form di-heteromers. These findings demonstrate the FLIM-FRET method as a tool for differentiating AMPAR subtypes in living cells, providing a foundation for studying subtype-specific receptor organization in excitatory synapses.",

    "content": "Our memories are reconstructions, prone to errors. Historically treated as a mere nuisance, memory errors have recently gained attention when found to be systematically shifted away from or towards non-reported items, promising insights into memory mechanisms. We argue that these biases are optimal and inevitable when the brain disentangles overlapping memory signals. Our simulations confirm that an ideal observer is biased, with bias direction depending not just on the absolute memory noise levels, but on the noise distribution between the memorized items. We test this prediction in four color memory experiments using a novel type of stimuli with independently varied noise levels. The results support our hypothesis, showing that targets with the same absolute noise level can be repelled from or attracted to non-target items, depending on their relative noise levels. These findings challenge the alternative models and support signal disentanglement as a unifying explanation of memory biases.",

    "title": "Large-Scale Brain Networks Track Gasoline Price Shifts",
    "content": "Macroeconomic conditions shape daily constraints and perceived environment, yet it remains unclear whether real-world economic dynamics are reflected in intrinsic brain organization at the population level. Here, I leveraged the Human Connectome Project (HCP) acquisition timeline as a naturalistic sampling frame to test whether macroeconomic time series vary with large-scale resting-state networks. Resting-state fMRI from 726 healthy young adults was aligned to quarterly macroeconomic indicators using the HCP \"Quarter\" variable. I quantified intrinsic organization using network functional connectivity (FC) and network-level amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF). I implemented (1) a quasi-natural experiment contrasting a pre- vs post-gasoline-price shock (collapse) cohort, and (2) quarter-level partial correlations between network measures and four macro indicators, including gasoline price, consumer sentiment, unemployment, and stock market return. Post-shock participants showed significantly higher within-network FC across all seven networks and selective increases in between-network coupling concentrated among sensory and attention systems, as well as limbic-default interactions. ALFF exhibited bidirectional shifts: Visual ALFF increased post-shock, whereas Limbic and Frontoparietal ALFF were higher pre-shock. Quarter-level analyses mirrored this differential pattern, with gas price positively associated with Limbic and Frontoparietal ALFF and negatively with Visual and Dorsal Attention ALFF. Across macro indicators, gasoline price and consumer sentiment showed the most widespread FC associations, with largely opposing correlation signatures, while unemployment and equity returns were comparatively weak after correction. These findings suggest that salient, behaviorally proximal macroeconomic dynamics, particularly energy price variation, track population-level differences in intrinsic brain network architecture, motivating future work with finer-grained timing and individual-level exposure measures to strengthen causal inference.",

    "content": "N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter release and membrane molecule trafficking by regulating membrane fusion. Dysfunction of NSF has been linked to neuropsychiatric disorders. Although the interaction of NSF with dopamine receptor 2 (D2R) and the resulting excitotoxicity from its reduction in vitro have been demonstrated, the role of NSF in D2R-expressing cells in vivo remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of NSF loss on the survival of D2R-expressing cells and on mouse behaviour. We generated D2R-specific NSF conditional knockout (Nsff/f;D2R-Cre) mice. Targeted deletion of NSF in D2R-expressing cells led to a significant decrease in D2R-expressing neurons, accompanied by increased apoptosis during postnatal development, reduced striatal volume, and substantially lowered dopamine levels in the striatum. Further evidence of dopaminergic dysfunction was shown by reduced dopamine transporter expression in the striatum and tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the striatum and substantia nigra. The Nsff/f;D2R-Cre mice exhibited attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behaviours, including hyperactivity and impulsivity. Notably, combined administration of methylphenidate and a D2R agonist effectively alleviated hyperactivity and impulsivity, indicating a potential synergistic approach for ADHD treatment. These findings highlight the critical role of NSF in the survival of D2R-expressing neurons and suggest that disruption of the NSF-D2R interaction may contribute to ADHD-like phenotypes. This study underscores the translational relevance of the Nsff/f;D2R-Cre model for ADHD and suggests that targeting D2R dysfunction, particularly in treatment-resistant cases, may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for ADHD.",

    "title": "Cross-modal quality transfer: enhancing MEG spatial resolution using BOLD-fMRI and Explainable machine learning.",
    "content": "Purpose: Blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) offer complementary insights into brain function, with BOLD-fMRI providing high spatial resolution and MEG offering high temporal sensitivity. This study aimed to enhance MEG spatial resolution through learning inter-modal relationships via data-driven fusion with BOLD-fMRI using explainable machine learning (xML). Methods: MEG and BOLD-fMRI data were collected for sixteen participants watching the same naturalistic visual stimulus. MEG signals were filtered into standard frequency bands and processed to match the haemodynamic response. Data were then decomposed using Tensorial Independent Component Analysis (TICA), yielding 250 MEG (25 per frequency band) and 30 BOLD-fMRI components. A set of Extreme Gradient Boosted (XGBoost) models were trained to predict MEG component activity from downsampled BOLD-fMRI components. The models with best-performing configuration of hyperparameters at this resolution were then used to generate voxelwise upsampled MEG maps using the natively higher-resolution BOLD-fMRI data. Performance was compared to trilinear interpolation using R2, mean squared error (MSE), and structural similarity index (SSI). Model interpretability was enhanced by generating Shapley values (SHAP), describing relationships between input data and model output. Results Models trained on 6mm3 data achieved high predictive performance on previously unseen data (R2 = 0.80, MSE = .07). Using higher-resolution 2mm3 BOLD-fMRI data, MEG activity was upsampled to 2mm3, resulting in more detailed image, while maintaining reasonable congruence to naive interpolation (R2 = .81, MSE = .06). Conclusions: This work demonstrates that explainable machine learning enables spatial super-resolution of MEG maps via BOLD-fMRI-informed quality transfer, enabling enhancement of spatial resolution, and offering improved localization, as well as means of generating data-driven insights into neurovascular coupling.",

    "content": "The hemodynamic response function (HRF) links neuronal activity to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. While most fMRI studies use a canonical HRF, increasing evidence from studies of healthy subjects suggests that the HRF depends on anatomical location and disease states. Here, we investigate how HRF variability relates to anatomical location and pathology in the epileptic brain, using a large simultaneous electroencephalogram and fMRI dataset. Applying HRF deconvolution and temporal decomposition, we built the first whole-brain HRF library specific to epilepsy, identifying four distinct shape groups. We mapped HRF features across parcellations of two atlases using novel Bayesian hierarchical models. In non-epileptogenic regions, HRF shape and spatial distributions align with findings from healthy subjects. Within pathological regions, they vary significantly according to pathology. Our results indicate that HRF variability is associated with pathology, in addition to its dependence on anatomical location, motivating region- and pathology-based HRF modulation in epilepsy studies.",

Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "<p>Bob and Arun here, creators of Stickerbox.<p>If AI were built for kids, what would it look like?<p>Asking that question led us to creativity, and more specifically, the power of kids\u2019 imaginations. We wanted to let kids combine the power of their ideas with AI tools but we needed to make sure we did it safely and in the right way.<p>Enter Stickerbox, a voice powered sticker printer. By combining AI image generation with thermal sticker printing, we instantly turn kids' wildest ideas into real stickers they can color, stick, and share.<p>What surprised us most is how the \u201cAI\u201d disappears behind the magic of the device. The moment that consistently amazes kids is when the printer finishes and they are holding their own idea as a real sticker. A ghost on a skateboard, a dragon doing its taxes, their dog as a superhero, anything they can dream of, they can hold in their hand. Their reactions are what pushed us to keep building, even though hardware can be really hard.<p>Along the way the scope of the project grew more than we expected: navigating supply chains, sourcing safe BPA/BPS free thermal paper, passing safety testing for a children\u2019s product, and designing an interface simple enough that a five year old can walk up and just talk to it. We also spent a lot of time thinking about kids\u2019 data and privacy so that parents would feel comfortable having this in their home.<p>Stickerbox is our attempt to make modern AI kid-safe, playful, and tangible. We\u2019d love to hear what you think!<p>P.S. If you\u2019re interested in buying one for yourself or as a gift, use code FREE3PACK to get an extra free pack of paper refills.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46330013\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46330013</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

Linggen indexes all my docs like it\u2019s remembering them\u2014it is awesome. One click loads the full architectural context, removing the \"cold start\" problem.<p>The Tech:<p>Local-First: Rust + LanceDB. Code and embeddings stay on your machine.

    "title": "Exploring internal representations of self-supervised networks: few-shot learning abilities and comparison with human semantics and recognition of objects",
    "content": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning have attracted significant attention from both machine learning and neuroscience. This is primarily because self-supervised methods do not require annotated supervisory information, making them applicable to training artificial networks without relying on large amounts of curated data, and potentially offering insights into how the brain adapts to its environment in an unsupervised manner. Although several previous studies have elucidated the correspondence between neural representations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and biological systems, the extent to which unsupervised or self-supervised learning can explain the human-like acquisition of categorically structured information remains less explored. In this study, we investigate the correspondence between the internal representations of DCNNs trained using a self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm and human semantics and recognition. To this end, we employ a few-shot learning evaluation procedure, which measures the ability of DCNNs to recognize novel concepts from limited exposure, to examine the inter-categorical structure of the learned representations. Two comparative approaches are used to relate the few-shot learning outcomes to human semantics and recognition, with results suggesting that the representations acquired through contrastive learning are well aligned with human cognition. These findings underscore the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks to model learning mechanisms similar to those of the human brain, particularly in scenarios where explicit supervision is unavailable, such as in human infants prior to language acquisition.",

Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION: TREM2 loss of function variants are associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). We molecularly assessed mice with the missense variant, R47H (Trem2*R47HHSS), and mice with additional cryptic splicing and reduced Trem2 expression (Trem2*R47H) while comparing relevance to human LOAD. METHODS: The aberrant splice acceptor site in the Trem2*R47H mouse was humanized resulting in the Trem2*R47H humanized splice site (Trem2*R47HHSS) mouse. RNA sequencing was performed on mouse brain tissue and signatures were compared to human postmortem brain expression in LOAD cohorts. RESULTS: Trem2*R47H mice had alternative splicing leading to reduced Trem2 expression; Trem2*R47HHSS mice expressed Trem2 at wild-type transcript and protein levels. Both models correlated with similar LOAD-associated signatures, and had similar effects on immune response, synapse, and vasculature biodomains. The Trem2*R47H model additionally affected extracellular matrix and myelination signatures. DISCUSSION: We demonstrated that Trem2*R47H and Trem2*R47HHSS mice are complementary models for the study of molecular contributions to LOAD pathology.",

    "title": "A hierarchical Bayesian inference model for volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals",
    "content": "Brain activities often follow an exponential family of distributions. The exponential distribution is the maximum entropy distribution of continuous random variables in the presence of a mean. The memoryless and peakless properties of an exponential distribution impose difficulties for data analysis methods. To estimate the rate parameter of multivariate exponential distribution from a time series of sensory inputs (i.e., observations), we constructed a hierarchical Bayesian inference model based on a variant of general hierarchical Brownian filter (GHBF). To account for the complex interactions among multivariate exponential random variables, the model estimates the second-order interaction of the rate intensity parameter in logarithmic space. Using variational Bayesian scheme, a family of closed-form and analytical update equations are introduced. These update equations also constitute a complete predictive coding framework. The simulation study shows that our model has the ability to evaluate the time-varying rate parameters and the underlying correlation structure of volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian inference model is of practical utility in analyzing high-dimensional neural activities.",

    "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

    "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
    "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

    "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
    "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

    "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

Now it is not easy to go past wave 4-5 if you are alone.</p> <p>The game can also be used to teach what compiling does and how to debug and step through the bytecode.</p> <p>PS: hard to say &quot;I&quot; made it, as it is all written by opus 4.5 for about a week and 200$ in api calls, but I am having fun playing it, and managed to play a game with my daughter which was lots of fun :)</p> <p>PPS: I also made a forth version its not as fun: <a href=\"https://github.com/jackdoe/roblox-forth-tower-defense\">https://github.com/jackdoe/roblox-forth-tower-defense</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jackdoezzz\"> /u/jackdoezzz </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pqhawf/roblox_python_tower_defense_demystify_methods_vs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pqhawf/roblox_python_tower_defense_demystify_methods_vs/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Comparison of multidomain assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion.",
    "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

    "title": "Mu opioid receptor mRNA and protein localization across the rat and mouse habenula",
    "content": "The habenula (Hb), which contains medial and lateral subdivisions (MHb and LHb, respectively), has high intensity mu opioid binding and receptor (MOR) expression, yet the details of MOR localization across these regions remains debated. MHb and LHb participate in largely non-overlapping neural circuits, therefore accurately resolving MOR expression across MHb and LHb is critical for understanding how MOR ligands impact behaviors. Here we utilized in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunocytochemistry (ICC) to systematically map Oprm1 mRNA and MOR protein throughout the habenular complex. We studied both rat and mouse tissue to evaluate conserved expression across two common research species. Importantly, we found mRNA and protein in both the MHb and LHb in both. In rat, 39 {+/-} 3% (MHb) and 21 {+/-} 4% (LHb) of cells expressed Oprm1. These proportions were greater in mouse: 57 {+/-} 1% (MHb) and 32 {+/-} 4% (LHb). Within each species, Oprm1 labeling density per positive cell was greater in MHb compared to LHb (p < 0.0001 for rat and mouse). The highest intensity labeling was localized along the lateral edge of the MHb for both methods. ICC showed MOR localized to fibers and somata in MHb and LHb. In LHb, MOR labeling was most dense in intermediate sections along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. In rats we also observed higher density labeling in dorsal LHb at intermediate AP levels and medial LHb more posteriorly. These results indicate that both MHb and LHb can contribute to MOR mediated actions through their respective circuits.",

    "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
    "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

    "title": "Predicting spiking activity from scalp EEG",
    "content": "Objective. Despite decades of electroencephalography (EEG) research, the relationship between EEG and underlying spiking dynamics remains unclear. This limits our ability to infer neural dynamics reflected in intracranial signals from EEG, a critical step to bridge electrophysiological findings across species and to develop non-invasive brain\u2013machine interfaces (BMIs). In this study, we aimed to estimate spiking activity in the visual cortex using non-invasive scalp EEG. Approach. We recorded spiking activity from a 32-channel floating microarray permanently implanted in parafoveal V1 and scalp-EEG in a male macaque monkey. While the animal fixated, the screen flickered at different temporal frequencies to induce steady-state visual evoked potentials. We analyzed the relationship between the V1 multi-unit spiking activity envelope (MUAe) and EEG frequency bands to predict MUAe at each time point from EEG. We extracted instantaneous spectrotemporal features of the EEG signal, including phase, amplitude, and phase-amplitude coupling of its frequency bands. Main results. Although the relationship between these spectrotemporal features and the V1 MUAe was complex and frequency-dependent, they were reliably predictive of the MUAe. Specifically, in a linear regression predicting MUAe from EEG, each EEG feature (phase, amplitude, coupling) contributed to model predictions. In addition, we found that MUAe predictions were better in shallow than deep cortical layers, and that the phase of stimulus frequency further improved MUAe predictions. Significance. Our study shows that a comprehensive account of spectrotemporal features of non-invasive EEG provides information on underlying spiking activity beyond what is available when only the amplitude or phase of the EEG signal is considered. This demonstrates the richness of the EEG signal and its complex relationship with neural spiking activity and suggests that using more comprehensive spectrotemporal signatures could improve BMI applications.",

    "content": "Adaptive neuromodulation systems and implantable brain-computer interfaces have made notable strides in recent years, translating experimental prototypes into clinical applications and garnering substantial attention from the public. This surge in interest is accompanied by increased scrutiny related to the safety, efficacy, and ethical implications of these systems, all of which must be directly addressed as we introduce new neurotechnologies. In response, we have synthesized the insights resulting from discussions between groups of experts in the field and summarized them into five key domains essential to therapeutic device development: (1) analyzing current landscape of neuromodulation devices and translational platforms (2) identifying clinical need, (3) understanding neural mechanisms, (4) designing viable technologies, and (5) addressing ethical concerns. The role of translational research platforms that allow rapid, iterative testing of hypotheses in both preclinical and clinical settings is emphasized. These platforms must balance experimental flexibility with patient safety and clear clinical benefit. Furthermore, requirements for interoperability, modularity, and wireless communication protocols are explored to support long-term usability and scalability. The current regulatory processes and funding models are examined alongside the ethical responsibilities of researchers and device manufacturers. Special attention is given to the role of patients as active contributors to research and to the long-term obligations we have to them as the primary burden-bearers of the implanted neurotechnologies. This article represents a synthesis of scientific, engineering, and clinical viewpoints to inform key stakeholders in the neuromodulation and brain-computer interface spaces.",

    "title": "Sigma receptors and mitochondria-associated ER membranes are converging therapeutic targets for Alzheimer\u2019s disease",
    "content": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) begins decades before clinical symptoms emerge. The \u201camyloid hypothesis\u201d suggests that amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition initiates a cascade of tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss leading to cognitive decline. The recent success of anti-A\u03b2 therapies such as Leqembi in prodromal or mild cognitive impaired patients underscores the importance of early intervention and A\u03b2 clearance. However, safety and cost limitations highlight the need for alternative therapeutic strategies. Small-molecule modulators of Sigma-1 and Sigma-2 receptors (\u03c31R and \u03c32R) have emerged as promising candidates for AD treatment. \u03c31R agonists exhibit neuroprotective and anti-amnestic effects under pathological conditions without affecting normal cognition. Beyond AD, \u03c31R is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases including ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), Parkinson\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s diseases, stroke, and epilepsy. \u03c31R plays a key role at mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs)\u2014specialized lipid raft-like domains that form functional membrane contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. \u03b2-secretase (BACE1), \u03b3-secretase, and their substrates APP and palmitoylated APP (palAPP) localize in the MAMs, promoting amyloidogenic A\u03b2 production. MAMs serve as dynamic hubs for inter-organelle communication, calcium signaling, and lipid metabolism. The \u201cMAM hypothesis\u201d proposes that MAM dysregulation drives early AD pathology and persists throughout disease progression, contributing to neurofibrillary tangle formation, calcium imbalance, and neuroinflammation. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of \u03c31R-mediated regulation of MAMs and its neuroprotective mechanisms, highlighting potential therapeutic opportunities for targeting \u03c31R in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "title": "Show HN: I open-sourced my Go and Next B2B SaaS Starter (deploy anywhere, MIT)",
    "content": "<p>Hi HN, I'm Mohammed, a technical founder who loves shipping and giving back to the community. I'm open-sourcing the full-stack engine that powers my B2B product, apflow.co.<p>What it is: A production B2B starter with a Go backend and Next.js frontend. Both are fully Dockerized with separate containers. No Vercel. No Supabase. Deploy the whole thing on a $6 VPS, or split frontend and backend across different providers. You own the infrastructure.<p>The problem I was solving:<p>Every SaaS starter I evaluated had the same issue: they locked me into someone else's platform. Vercel for hosting. PlanetScale for the database. Serverless functions billing per invocation. Fine for prototypes, but costs become unpredictable at scale and migrating away is painful.<p>I wanted something I could deploy on any Linux box with docker-compose up. Something where I could host the frontend on Cloudflare Pages and the backend on a Hetzner VPS if I wanted. No vendor-specific APIs buried in my code.<p>Why Go for the backend:<p>Go gives me exactly what I need for a SaaS backend:<p>Tiny footprint. The backend idles at ~50MB RAM. On a cheap VPS, that headroom lets me run more services without upgrading.\nConcurrency without complexity. Billing webhooks, file uploads, and AI calls run concurrently without callback hell.\nCompile-time type safety. Using SQLC, my SQL compiles to type-safe Go. If the query is wrong, it fails at build time, not in production.\nPredictable performance. No garbage collection pauses that surprise you under load.\nThe architecture (Modular Monolith):<p>I didn't want microservices complexity for a small team, but I needed clean separation. I built a Modular Monolith: features like Auth, Billing, and AI are isolated Go modules with explicit interfaces, but they deploy as a single binary.<p>This structure also made AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code) dramatically more effective. Because every module has strict boundaries, the AI knows exactly where new code belongs and doesn't break other modules.<p>Full-stack, not just backend:<p>Backend: Go 1.25 + Gin + SQLC (type-safe SQL, no ORM) + PostgreSQL with pgvector\nFrontend: Next.js 16 + React 19 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui\nCommunication: The frontend consumes a clean REST API. You can swap Next.js for any framework that speaks HTTP.\nInfrastructure: Separate Dockerfiles for frontend and backend. Deploy together or apart.\nWhat's pre-built:<p>The boring infrastructure is solved so you can focus on your actual product:<p>Auth + RBAC: Stytch B2B integration with Organizations, Teams, and Roles. Multi-tenant data isolation enforced at the query level.\nBilling: Polar.sh as Merchant of Record. Handles subscriptions, invoices, and global tax/VAT.

    "title": "Mapping of critical prosodic and phonetic networks in post-stroke apraxia of speech",
    "content": "Purpose: Many have made proposals to better diagnose and/or classify post-stroke apraxia of speech (AOS), with some arguing for the separation of AOS into behavioral subtypes. Recent studies of primary progressive AOS have promoted a separation of prosodic and phonetic subtypes, aligning with a dual-motor coordination model separating the neural substrates of prosodic and phonetic function. Motivated by the limited corroboration of these subtypes in post-stroke AOS, here we present mapping results in a cohort of stroke survivors aiming to identify distinct neural substrates for prosodic and phonetic aspects of speech motor coordination. Methods: Left-hemisphere stroke survivors (n = 127; 64 with AOS) received speech-language evaluation and neuroimaging at the Center for the Study and Treatment of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR). AOS severity was quantified via the Apraxia of Speech Rating Scale (ASRS). We utilized a novel lesion-symptom mapping technique with an emphasis on prediction that identifies ensembles of regions supporting performance in the prosodic and phonetic domains. Results: An ensemble of networks supporting prosodic function localized to dorsal and ventral (but primarily dorsal) sensorimotor cortex, as well as a distributed network of white matter pathways connecting Rolandic cortex to auditory regions and cerebellum, emphasizing the role of auditory feedback processing and laryngeal control in supporting prosodic function. A separate but partially overlapping network supporting phonetic function localized primarily to ventral Rolandic cortex and the arcuate fasciculus. Conclusions: This work represents the first mapping of prosodic and phonetic subtypes in post-stroke AOS in a large cohort of individuals. We hope our results motivate the development of assessment and treatment techniques individually targeting prosodic and phonetic functioning to better serve individuals with AOS and facilitate clinical discussion of the disorder.",

    "title": "Ectopic engraftment of nociceptive neurons derived from hPSCs for pain relief and joint homeostasis",
    "content": "Chronic pain arises from the interplay of inflammatory signals that activate and sensitize nociceptors within injured tissues. Most analgesics fail clinically due to their mono targeted mechanisms. Here, we apply human pluripotent stem cell derived nociceptive neurons (hPSC NNs) as therapeutic agents for osteoarthritis, targeting both pain and joint degeneration. We generated sensory neurons from hPSCs and identified CD200 as a nociceptor marker. Transcriptomic and functional profiling revealed that CD200high hPSC NNs closely resemble human nociceptors, expressing pain relevant receptors and ion channels. Strikingly, ectopic transplantation of CD200high hPSC NNs into the knee joint of osteoarthritic mice reduced pain and promoted bone and cartilage repair, whereas CD200low cells exhibited no benefit. Mechanistically, human and mouse proteomics suggest that CD200high hPSC NNs act as decoys by sequestering inflammatory ligands while secreting reparative factors in joint tissues. These findings uncover a fundamental role of nociceptors in tissue repair, providing a multi-targeted, disease modifying strategy for OA and chronic pain.",

    "title": "Prion shedding is reduced by chronic wasting disease vaccination",
    "content": "Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a strictly fatal and highly contagious prion disease of wild and farmed cervids currently expanding in North America. Prion diseases are caused by conversion of the cellular prion protein to its pathological isoform PrPSc. Vaccination is considered a promising strategy to contain CWD, even though prion diseases do not show classical immune responses. For CWD containment, it is important that vaccines reduce shedding of prions in excreta, a major contributor to transmission. Here, we tested the effect of vaccines on prion shedding in feces and urine by vaccinating and prion infecting knock-in mice that recapitulate CWD pathogenesis as found in cervids. Vaccination reduced or even prevented CWD shedding in feces and urine collected between 30-90% of incubation time to disease. This is the first report showing that prion shedding can be blocked in a prion disease. For CWD specifically it may reduce the environmental prion burden and break the disease transmission cycle.",

    "title": "Integrating brain structure and function for the neurobiology and genetics of language",
    "content": "Brain structure and function have largely been studied separately in relation to the neurobiology and genetics of language. Here we used linked independent component analysis to integrate language network functional connectivity with brain volumetric and white matter structure in 32,677 UK Biobank participants, followed by analysis of behavioural, neurobiological and genetic correlates of the derived multimodal structure-function imaging components. Stronger functional connectivity between brain language areas was associated with increased volume of parts of the cerebellum and motor cortex, together with smaller ventricles and sensory parietal and occipital areas. The brain structure-function language components mediated an association between vocabulary level and polygenic scores for reading ability. We report 18 genomic loci associated with brain structure-function language components. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability estimates for these components were 23-30%, and there was significant enrichment of heritability in primate-conserved genomic loci and fetal brain human-gained enhancer elements. This study revealed that structural correlates of functional language network connectivity extend well beyond previously defined language areas of the brain, and highlights the value of multimodal brain phenotyping for human neurogenetic discovery.",

    "title": "Inconsistent Subthalamic Beta Expression in the Local Field Potential amid In- and Anti-Phasic Neuronal Bursts.",
    "content": "Background: Elevated beta (12-32 Hz) activity in the local field potential (LFP) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease and closely tied to synchronized spiking. Albeit the biomarker's prevalence has not been independently and reliably assessed, it is employed to guide deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead implantation. Likewise, beta is under investigation to inform DBS programming and adaptive DBS. This study assesses the applicability of these efforts by quantifying the biomarker's prevalence and investigating its relationship to synchronized beta-bursting neurons. Methods: STN LFP and spiking activity of n = 156 patients with Parkinson's disease from six DBS centers recorded via microelectrodes was examined. Spectral peaks in the LFPs were classified and the absence of artifacts confirmed. The distribution of phase angles between beta LFP and spiking of individual beta-bursting neurons were explored. Findings: Bilateral beta LFP expression was observed in 47.25% of patients, and in 65.59% of hemispheres. LFP-synchronized neuronal spiking clustered in two-thirds of neurons at a primary and in one-third at a secondary LFP phase (182.84 degree phase shifted). This applied on the group level and for individual patients across different DBS centers. Interpretation: Beta-informed approaches mandate reliable biomarker expression, a requirement not met by slightly more than half of herein investigated patients. This is particularly troublesome for intraoperative guidance wherein the cause of biomarker absence, including DBS lead misplacement or a balanced ratio of phasic and antiphasic spiking neurons, cannot be determined, decreasing insight and increasing doubt. Although beta LFPs remain a valuable biomarker, routine clinical practice should not rely on beta alone; instead, multiple biomarkers (i.e. beta-gamma coupling, finely tuned gamma and/or cortico-cortical beta-band coupling) should be evaluated simultaneously to increase robustness.",

    "content": "The investigation of cultured biological neural networks is a critical frontier in neuroscience with profound implications for the advancement of brain-machine interfaces, treatments of neurological diseases, and fundamental insights into neural computation and cognition. Advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology and machine learning are converging to enable novel approaches to interrogating neural circuits in vitro. However, progress in this emerging field is hampered by the technical challenges and resource-intensive nature of acquiring datasets suitable for machine learning. Experimental recordings typically do not allow for interactive learning and generally lack ground-truth information that would enable rigorous algorithm development and validation. To overcome the limitations of experimental setups, simulated biophysical models of neurons and neuronal networks can serve as crucial accelerators. They allow for more controlled and systematic exploration than currently possible with living cultures and serve as interpretable intermediaries between abstract computational theory and complex biological reality. Using this approach, we introduce livn: an open source interactive simulation environment for learning to control in vitro neural networks. livn generates synthetic neural data with ground truth at scale, enabling the development and testing of ML models in interactive settings that mimic experimental platforms. We describe benchmark tasks that challenge ML models to exploit simulated neural dynamics and release generated synthetic datasets that mimic in vitro systems. By providing an open, extensible platform for developing and benchmarking machine learning models, livn aims to accelerate progress in both ML-driven understanding and engineering of in vitro neural systems and fundamental understanding of computation in biological neural networks.",

    "content": "Homeotherms maintain a steady body temperature through thermoregulation, a process critical for survival during fasting, in which the brain has to defend energy-costly body temperature while reducing energy expenditure to conserve energy reserve; however, the neural basis for defending body temperature remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that AgRP neuron lesion led to lethality during time-restricted feeding but no obvious impact on HFD-induced obesity or obesity-reducing responses to glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonism. The lesion disrupted adaptive feeding behaviors during time-restricted feeding and reduced motivational feeding. Notably, the lethality was caused by hypothermia instead of reduced food intake. The lesion also caused failure in body temperature maintenance during acute fasting in cold. Fasting-induced activation in AgRP neurons was abrogated when mice were placed in a warm environment. Our results identify the physiological role for AgRP neurons in defending body temperature during restricted feeding but dispensable for body weight regulation with food ad libitum.",

    "title": "Lysergic acid diethylamide pretreatment prolongs brain-stimulation induced neural activity",
    "content": "A leading theory for how psychedelics are able to produce robust clinical improvement and preclinical behavioral changes is that psychedelics act through neuroplastic mechanisms to induce lasting structural and functional alterations in neural circuits. However, psychedelics produce these effects across wide swaths of the brain. Based on our prior work, we hypothesized that engaging a specific brain circuit with focal brain stimulation during the window of enhanced plasticity produced by psychedelics would lead to more persistent alterations in the activity of that circuit. To test this, we administered either saline (SAL) or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) to rats 24 hours prior to electrical stimulation targeting the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Brain activity was recorded before, during, and after stimulation using depth electrodes implanted in four bilateral frontostriatal regions. To assess changes in neural activity, we trained general logistic classifiers to distinguish between time points (e.g., pre-stimulation vs. post-stimulation) and then compared model performances across groups (e.g., LSD vs. SAL). As such, model performance represents the degree of difference between the two neural states (pre vs. post), and a significant difference between groups indicates a larger change in brain activity in one group. We found that LSD pretreatment, compared to SAL, resulted in larger and longer-lasting changes in brain activity following stimulation. Immunohistochemistry revealed that stimulation led to the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway, and the combination of LSD and stimulation led to alterations in perineuronal net (PNN) integrity. Regardless of pretreatment, brain activity states recorded during stimulation did not capture the brain state that persisted in the minutes or days that followed. This work has important implications for understanding the general effects of brain stimulation and provides strong support for the development of psychedelic-assisted brain stimulation approaches. By increasing the durability of brain stimulation-induced changes in activity, this approach could lead to a reduction in relapse rates, which currently limit the impact of non-invasive stimulation treatments.",

    "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
    "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

    "title": "Enhancing dementia and cognitive decline detection with large language models and speech representation learning",
    "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

    "title": "Common characteristics of variants linked to autism spectrum disorder in the WAVE regulatory complex",
    "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

    "title": "Simplex polynomial in complex networks and its applications to compute the Euler characteristic",
    "content": "In algebraic topology, a k-dimensional simplex is defined as a convex polytope consisting of k + 1 vertices. If spatial dimensionality is not considered, it corresponds to the complete graph with k + 1 vertices in graph theory. The alternating sum of the number of simplices across dimensions yields a topological invariant known as the Euler characteristic, which has gained significant attention due to its widespread application in fields such as topology, homology theory, complex systems, and biology. The most common method for calculating the Euler characteristic is through simplicial decomposition and the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 formula. In this study, we introduce a new \u201csubgraph\u201d polynomial, termed the simplex polynomial, and explore some of its properties. Using those properties, we provide a new method for computing the Euler characteristic and prove the existence of the Euler characteristic as an arbitrary integer by constructing the corresponding simplicial complex structure. When the Euler characteristic is 1, we determined a class of corresponding simplicial complex structures. Moreover, for three common network structures, we present the recurrence relations for their simplex polynomials and their corresponding Euler characteristics. Finally, at the end of this study, three basic questions are raised for the interested readers to study deeply.",

    "content": "IntroductionThe combination of CNN and Transformer has attracted much attention for medical image segmentation due to its superior performance at present. However, the segmentation performance is affected by limitations such as the local receptive field and static weights of CNN convolution operations, as well as insufficient information exchange between Transformer local regions.MethodsTo address these issues, an integrated attention mechanism and pyramid pooling network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an efficient channel attention mechanism is embedded into CNN to extract more comprehensive image features. Then, CBAM_ASPP module is introduced into the bottleneck layer to obtain multi-scale context information. Finally, in order to address the limitations of traditional convolution, depthwise separable convolution is used to achieve a lightweight network.ResultsThe experiments based on the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset and ACDC dataset showed that the proposed IAP-TransUNet achieved Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 78.85% and 90.46%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, for the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset, the Hausdorff distance was reduced by 2.92%. For the ACDC dataset, the segmentation accuracy of the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle was improved by 0.14%, 1.89%, and 0.23%, respectively.DiscussionThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network has improved the effectiveness and shows strong performance on both CT and MRI data, which suggests its potential for generalization across different medical imaging modalities.",

The relationship between the SR and the animal brain has been studied, and several neural network models for computing the SR have been proposed based on the findings. However, studies on implementation of the SR involving action selection have not yet advanced significantly. Therefore, we explore possible mechanisms by which the SR is utilized biologically for action selection and learning optimal action policies. The actor-critic architecture is a promising model of animal behavioral learning in terms of its correspondence to the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, so it is suitable for our purpose. In this study, we construct neural network models for behavioral learning using the SR. By using them to perform reinforcement learning, we investigate their properties. Specifically, we investigated the effect of using different state representations for the actor and critic in the actor-critic method, and also compared the actor-critic method with Q-learning and SARSA. We found the difference between the effect of using the SR for the actor and the effect of using the SR for the critic in the actor-critic method, and observed that using the SR in conjunction with one-hot encoding makes it possible to learn with the benefits of both representations. These results suggest the possibility that the striatum can learn using multiple state representations complementarily.",

    "content": "The human brain exhibits remarkable sensitivity to auditory patterns. Previous research has shown that beyond the detection of such patterns, humans form memories for them that are implicit, robust to interference, and persistent over time. Here, we examine the mechanisms underlying implicit memory formation for reoccurring regular tone patterns using UHF fMRI. Prior to scanning, implicit memory was induced through a standard behavioral task where participants detected regular patterns embedded in random tone sequences. Unbeknownst to participants, five regular patterns reoccurred sporadically (every 1.5 min) across trials. Consistent with previous reports, behavioral performance indicated a reaction time advantage to reoccurring patterns, confirming the formation of implicit memory traces. During passive listening in the scanner, regularity engaged the superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, insula, putamen, and hippocampus, a result we interpret as reflecting the higher perceptual precision of regular patterns. Reoccurrence interacted with regularity in the superior temporal gyrus and a frontal cluster, showing higher activity for reoccurring compared to novel regular patterns. The hippocampus showed sensitivity to reoccurrence in both regular and random patterns. Together, these results indicate that the neocortex may selectively amplify reoccurring inputs in line with their enhanced (memory driven) perceptual precision.",

    "content": "Robustness, defined as a system's ability to maintain functional reliability in the face of perturbations, is achieved through its capacity to filter external disturbances using internal priors encoded in its structure and states. While biophysical neural networks are widely recognized for their robustness, the precise mechanisms underlying this resilience remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore how orientation-selective neurons arranged in a one-dimensional ring network respond to perturbations, with the aim of uncovering insights into the robustness of visual subsystems in the brain. By analyzing the steady-state dynamics of a rate-based network, we characterize how the activation state of neurons influences the network's response to disturbances. Our results demonstrate that the activation state of neurons, rather than their firing rates alone, governs the network's sensitivity to perturbations. We further show that lateral connectivity modulates this effect by shaping the response profile across spatial frequency components. These findings suggest a state-dependent filtering mechanism that contributes to the robustness of visual circuits, offering theoretical insight into how different components of perturbations are selectively modulated within the network.",

    "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

    "title": "Altered Frontoparietal, Temporal and Sensorimotor Structure-Function Coupling and Its Genetic Underpinnings in Bipolar Disorder",
    "content": "Background: Structure-function coupling quantifies how strongly structural connectivity supports functional communication across brain regions. Investigating structure-function coupling in bipolar disorder, a condition marked by dysconnectivity, may elucidate underlying neural mechanisms. We examined regional structure-function coupling in bipolar disorder and its genetic underpinnings to characterize network-level disruptions. Methods: Regional structure-function coupling was estimated in UK Biobank participants using edge-wise regression between measures of structural connectivity and functional connectivity. Bipolar disorder (n=163) and controls (n=326) were age and sex-matched and compared using general linear models. To explore the genetic basis of these structure-function coupling alterations, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted in an independent UK Biobank sample (n=38,190) for regions showing significant group differences. Results: Structure-function coupling demonstrated a unimodal-to-transmodal gradient with highest coupling evident in visual regions (R^2=0.29) and lowest in the insula (R^2=0.03). The Bipolar disorder group showed higher structure-function coupling in the temporal pole and superior frontal gyrus (beta=0.269; beta=0.211) and lower coupling in the supramarginal, precentral, and postcentral gyri and the frontal pole (beta=-0.206 to -0.275). GWAS identified seven significant loci, with mapped genes (e.g., KAT6B, INPP5A, PLCE1) involved in neuronal development and cellular signaling. Conclusion: Bipolar disorder showed altered structure-function coupling across regions implicating multiple networks. These alterations suggest stronger structure-function alignment in limbic and attention networks and weaker alignment in sensorimotor, executive, frontoparietal, and salience regions relative to controls, potentially disrupting flexible polysynaptic communication. Altered coupling may relate to genetic variation affecting neurodevelopment, neuronal signaling, and synaptic plasticity. Together, these findings offer novel insight into the architectural contributions to the pathophysiology underlying bipolar disorder.",

    "content": "Distinct microtubule arrays form in axons and dendrites defining their functions in neurons. These arrays are thought to develop through separate processes. Here we challenge this view by showing that axons and dendrites develop by a unifying process: slowdown of microtubule retrograde flow (MT-RF), a recently discovered mechanism of microtubule dynamics. By integrating quantitative data of microtubule dynamics and distributions into a newly developed biophysical model of microtubules across developmental stages, we uncover that MT-RF interacts with microtubule stability and nucleation. Without MT-RF slowdown, this interaction suppresses development and maintenance of axonal and dendritic microtubule arrays. In axons, MT-RF slowdown enables microtubules to reach the tip, even at long distances, supporting axon growth. In dendrites, late MT-RF slowdown facilitates an efficient increase in stable microtubules. Thus, our data-integrated model reveals MT-RF slowdown as central for the development of distinct neuronal compartments, providing a unifying mechanism for microtubule-related physiology.",

    "title": "Glucodynamic Network Transitions of the Human Brain",
    "content": "Variability in neuronal firing patterns enables the brain to flexibly transition between network states, a hallmark of adaptive information processing. Yet the energetic basis of this flexibility remains unknown. Here, we report that the capacity of the brain to shift between network states is contingent on the moment-to-moment variability of glucose metabolism. Using simultaneous resting-state functional FDG-PET and BOLD fMRI in 78 healthy adults (20 to 86 years), we quantified brain metabolic and haemodynamic variability, complexity, and dynamic network connectivity. Individuals with greater variability and complexity of glucose metabolism demonstrated a broader repertoire of network states, marked by globally connected and influential central hubs. Individuals who achieved a broader range of network states had better cognitive performance. In older adults, widespread reductions in dynamic metabolic connectivity were observed. Glucodynamic parameters predicted age and cognitive performance more robustly than haemodynamic measures. These findings reveal that functional network dynamics are emergent properties of the brain's metabolic architecture and that the organisation of large-scale neural circuits is constrained by energetic principles. This understanding may provide critical new insights into the metabolic basis of brain ageing, neurodegeneration and psychiatric conditions.",

    "title": "A Multimodal Framework for Understanding Perceptual Segmentation of Natural Scenes In Autism",
    "content": "Understanding how individuals segment complex natural scenes into perceptual segments is essential for explaining both typical and atypical sensory processing. In Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), differences in visual segmentation and integration are widely documented. However, existing paradigms often rely on simplified stimuli and do not capture the dynamic, naturalistic processes underlying real world scene segmentation. To overcome those limitations, in this work we present a novel, multimodal experimental framework. The framework combines precisely timed, trial-based perceptual measurements with electroencephalography (EEG) to examine how neural activity aligns temporally with segmentation decisions and with eye-tracking to examine visual exploration strategies and attention allocation. Neurotypical (NT) participants and participants with ASD aged 16 years and above viewed natural scenes and textures and indicated whether two cued image regions belonged to the same or different perceptual segments. Responses to multiple pairs of cues enabled the estimation of subjectively perceived segmentation maps and the associated uncertainty. Across NT and ASD populations, we analyzed segmentation maps, reaction time distributions, gaze profiles, and trial-aligned neural responses. Behavioral results revealed slower and more idiosyncratic segmentation patterns in ASD. Eye-tracking analyses also demonstrated distinct gaze patterns suggesting broader exploration of the images during early viewing. EEG analyses demonstrated delayed & more diffuse occipital activation in ASD, accompanied by reduced global field power at several key time windows spanning stimulus presentation. Together, these findings establish a reproducible method for studying the temporal and spatial components of natural scene segmentation and indicate meaningful behavioral and neural distinctions in ASD. This framework provides a methodological bridge between controlled experimental stimuli and real-world perception in both neurotypical and neurodivergent populations.",

Offering high spatial precision and the ability to target both cortical and deep brain regions, TUS uses focused ultrasound waves to induce acute and delayed effects on brain activity. We propose that combining TUS with neurofeedback methods and/or specific cognitive training exercises may capitalise on these neuroplastic effects, thereby augmenting and prolonging their impact to support lasting improvements in self-regulation. We focus on the domains of sleep and emotion regulation, where such an integrated approach may strengthen resilience and promote healthier functioning in the general population. Our aim is to highlight the potential of TUS-based integrated interventions for supporting mental health and well-being in non-clinical populations and to outline key directions for future research.",

    "title": "Gender perception of pareidolia faces in emergency department patients: the influence of physician gender",
    "content": "BackgroundThe assessment of gender perception influenced by ambiguous facial cues in patients requiring emergency medical attention remains ambiguous. Pareidolia faces represent unconscious errors in facial recognition, wherein a wide array of visual attributes contribute to the interpretation of facial features. This study aims to explore the mechanisms underlying gender perception in individuals undergoing emergency medical treatment, employing an innovative digital pareidolia assessment to evaluate gender perception within the context of face pareidolia.MethodsFifty adult patients treated by a female physician in the green triage zone participated in the study. Target images consisted of face pareidolia images, while non-target images were scrambled. All images were standardized for size, tone, and light intensity. Patients instructed the pareidolia images and were asked if they discerned a face; if they answered \u2018No,\u2019 the next image was shown. If they saw a face, they identified the associated gender. Their responses and reaction times were systematically recorded digitally.ResultsOur findings revealed that, regardless of wait times, patients were significantly more likely to identify pareidolia faces as male rather than female, especially after being examined by a female physician. Additionally, male patients exhibited slightly longer reaction times than females when responding to pareidolia images.ConclusionThe outcomes of this investigation provide critical insights into the influence of pareidolia on gender perception of faces in the emergency department setting. It underscores the notion that gender biases, which arise from both biological and sociocultural factors, can affect the dynamics of patient-physician interactions.",

    "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
    "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

    "title": "Distinct talkers combat catastrophic failures of spatial attention due to interruption",
    "content": "Task-irrelevant features can impact formation of auditory objects and influence the effectiveness of selective attention, including the buildup of attention over time. Using a previously established paradigm exploring the effects of random interruptions on spatial selective attention, this study explores how the task-irrelevant feature of talker identity impacts the buildup of spatial attention and whether it alters the impact of interruptions. Participants performed a sequence recall task in which participants were presented with two competing syllable sequences coming from different spatial directions and were asked to report the syllable sequence coming from the target direction. On half of the trials, an unpredictable, novel interrupting sound occurred, disrupting attentional focus. Two experiments explored how talker influenced performance, specifically, whether 1) making the two streams come from different talkers facilitates task performance and reduces the impact of interruption compared to when the streams are spoken by the same talker, and 2) talker discontinuity interferes with attention buildup and harms syllable recall performance compared to when the talker is the same from one syllable to the next. Our results showed that distinct talker features, though task-irrelevant in this spatial task, significantly improved syllable recall performance and reduced the impact of interrupters. Further, irrelevant talker discontinuities damaged attention buildup and reduced syllable recall performance.",

    "title": "A method for measuring first glymphatic influx of a cerebrospinal fluid tracer in the human brain",
    "content": "IntroductionThe glymphatic system is a brain-wide perivascular transport route for fluids and solutes in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) serves as a conduit for solute transport and clearance of brain waste. Intrathecal contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where the intrathecal contrast agent serves as a CSF tracer, has been developed to measure glymphatic function in humans. The normalized MRI T1 signal is a semiquantitative measure of CSF flow and exchange with the brain. Objective: To estimate first-time tracer appearance within brain tissue after intrathecal tracer injection.MethodsThis study implemented segmented regression analysis to estimate the first-time tracer appearance of an intrathecal tracer within brain tissues. An increase (breakpoint) in the normalized MRI T1 signal was defined to represent first glymphatic influx of the tracer. The study included 30 reference (REF) subjects with no identified CSF disturbance and 15 patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). We developed and evaluated the method in REF subjects and further compared it between the two study groups.ResultsThe time to initial glymphatic tracer enrichment in the REF cohort was approximately 1\u202fh in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cerebral cortex and ranged from two to 4\u202fh in the corresponding white matter regions. In subcortical limbic structures and basal ganglia structures, it was 0.6 and 2.2\u202fh, respectively. Compared with REF subjects, IIH patients presented a non-significant mean difference in the first appearance of \u00b10.5\u202fh in the cerebral cortex and white matter regions, with somewhat longer estimated delays in the parietal and insular white matter regions. The results are presented as time series plots and estimates with 95% confidence intervals. Additionally, we provide supplementary R code, which can be adapted for use in future studies, and outline a basic assessment of true versus estimated breakpoints using simulated data.ConclusionSegmented regression was found feasible to quantify the time to first glymphatic enrichment, i.e., increase in the normalized MRI T1 signal. Moreover, the method seems reasonable to differentiate first glymphatic influx between the cohorts.",

    "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

    "title": "VibTac: A High-Resolution High-Bandwidth Tactile Sensing Finger for Multi-Modal Perception in Robotic Manipulation",
    "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

    "title": "Age-Related Impact in Illusory Torque Cues Induced by Asymmetric Vibrations",
    "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

    "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

    "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
    "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

    "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

Situated at the intersection of media archaeology and speculative design, the project questions dominant narratives of progress by embedding generative AI in an obsolete, tactile interface. Through public exhibitions and aesthetic intervention, we demonstrate how slowness, friction, and material render artificial intelligence not only visible but open to critical inquiry. Drawing on concepts such as zombie media, technostalgia, and speculative design, we argue that reappropriating outdated technologies enables new forms of critical engagement. Erika - the AI-enabled typewriter - functions as both interface and interruption, making space for reflection, irony, and cultural memory. In a moment of accelerated digital abstraction, projects like this foreground the value of deliberate slowness, experiential materiality, and historical depth. We conclude by advocating for a historicist design sensibility that challenges presentism and reorients human-machine interaction toward alternative, perceived futures.",

    "title": "The Agony of Opacity: Foundations for Reflective Interpretability in AI-Mediated Mental Health Support",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.16206v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Throughout history, a prevailing paradigm in mental healthcare has been one in which distressed people may receive treatment with little understanding around how their experience is perceived by their care provider, and in turn, the decisions made by their provider around how treatment will progress. Paralleling this offline model of care, people who seek mental health support from AI chatbots are similarly provided little context for how their expressions of distress are processed by the model, and subsequently, the logic that may underlie model responses. People in severe distress who turn to AI chatbots for support thus find themselves caught between black boxes, with unique forms of agony that arise from these intersecting opacities, including misinterpreting model outputs or attributing greater capabilities to a model than are yet possible, which has led to documented real-world harms. Building on empirical research from clinical psychology and AI safety, alongside rights-oriented frameworks from medical ethics, we describe how the distinct psychological state induced by severe distress can influence chatbot interaction patterns, and argue that this state of mind (combined with differences in how a user might perceive a chatbot compared to a care provider) uniquely necessitates a higher standard of interpretability in comparison to general AI chatbot use. Drawing inspiration from newer interpretable treatment paradigms, we then describe specific technical and interface design approaches that could be used to adapt interpretability strategies from four specific mental health fields (psychotherapy, community-based crisis intervention, psychiatry, and care authorization) to AI models, including consideration of the role of interpretability in the treatment process and tensions that may arise with greater interpretability.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.16081v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Social interactions incorporate nonverbal signals to convey emotions alongside speech, including facial expressions and body gestures. Generative models have demonstrated promising results in creating full-body nonverbal animations synchronized with speech; however, evaluations using statistical metrics in 2D settings fail to fully capture user-perceived emotions, limiting our understanding of model effectiveness. To address this, we evaluate emotional 3D animation generative models within a Virtual Reality (VR) environment, emphasizing user-centric metrics emotional arousal realism, naturalness, enjoyment, diversity, and interaction quality in a real-time human-agent interaction scenario. Through a user study (N=48), we examine perceived emotional quality for three state of the art speech-driven 3D animation methods across two emotions happiness (high arousal) and neutral (mid arousal). Additionally, we compare these generative models against real human expressions obtained via a reconstruction-based method to assess both their strengths and limitations and how closely they replicate real human facial and body expressions. Our results demonstrate that methods explicitly modeling emotions lead to higher recognition accuracy compared to those focusing solely on speech-driven synchrony. Users rated the realism and naturalness of happy animations significantly higher than those of neutral animations, highlighting the limitations of current generative models in handling subtle emotional states. Generative models underperformed compared to reconstruction-based methods in facial expression quality, and all methods received relatively low ratings for animation enjoyment and interaction quality, emphasizing the importance of incorporating user-centric evaluations into generative model development. Finally, participants positively recognized animation diversity across all generative models.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.16063v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding patients experiences is essential for advancing patient centered care, especially in chronic diseases that require ongoing communication. However, qualitative thematic analysis, the primary approach for exploring these experiences, remains labor intensive, subjective, and difficult to scale. In this study, we developed a multi agent large language model framework that automates qualitative thematic analysis through three agents (Instructor, Thematizer, CodebookGenerator), named Collaborative Theme Identification Agent (CoTI). We applied CoTI to 12 heart failure patient interviews to analyze their perceptions of medication intensity. CoTI identified key phrases, themes, and codebook that were more similar to those of the senior investigator than both junior investigators and baseline NLP models. We also implemented CoTI into a user-facing application to enable AI human interaction in qualitative analysis. However, collaboration between CoTI and junior investigators provided only marginal gains, suggesting they may overrely on CoTI and limit their independent critical thinking.",

    "title": "Augmented Reality-Based Smart Structural Health Monitoring System With Accurate 3D Model Alignment",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.16008v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has become increasingly critical due to the rapid deterioration of civil infrastructure. Traditional methods involving heavy equipment are costly and time-consuming. Recent SHM approaches use advanced non-contact sensors, IoT, and Augmented Reality (AR) glasses for faster inspections and immersive experiences during inspections. However, current methods lack quantitative damage data, remote collaboration support, and accurate 3D model alignment with the real structure. Recognizing these current challenges, this paper proposes an AR-based system that integrates Building Information Modelling (BIM) visualization and follows a flexible manipulation approach of 3D holograms to improve structural condition assessments. The proposed framework utilizes the Vuforia software development toolkit to enable the automatic alignment of 3D models to the real structure, ensuring successful model alignment to assist users in accurately visualizing damage locations. The framework also enables flexible manipulation of damage locations, making it easier for users to identify multiple damage points in the 3D models. The system is validated through lab-scale and full-scale bridge use cases, with data transfer performance analyzed under 4G and 5G conditions for remote collaboration. This study demonstrates that the proposed AR-based SHM framework successfully aligns 3D models with real structures, allowing users to manually adjust models and damage locations. The experimental results confirm its feasibility for remote collaborative inspections, highlighting significant improvements with 5G networks. Nevertheless, performance under 4G remains acceptable, ensuring reliability even without 5G coverage.",

Among these challenges, the non-stationarity of the EEG signal is a key problem as it leads to various changes in the signal. There are changes within a session, across sessions, and across individuals. Variations over time for a given individual must be carefully managed to improve the BCI performance, including its accuracy, reliability, and robustness over time. This review paper presents and discusses the causes of non-stationarity in the EEG signal, along with its consequences for BCI applications, including covariate shift. The paper reviews recent studies on covariate shift, focusing on methods for detecting and correcting this phenomenon. Signal processing and machine learning techniques can be employed to normalize the EEG signal and address the covariate shift.",

Consequently, this article proposes a dynamic web UI optimization through CR assessment using Finite Exponential Continuous State Machine (FECSM) and Quokka Nonlinear Difference Swarm Optimization Algorithm (QNDSOA). Initially, the design and user interaction related information is collected as well as pre-processed for min-max normalization. Next, the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)-based features are extracted, followed by user behaviour pattern grouping. Meanwhile, the CR assessment is done using FECSM. Then, the proposed Bidirectional Gated Luong and Mish Recurrent Unit (BiGLMRU) is used to classify the User eXperience (UX) change type, which is labelled based on the User Interface Change Prediction Index (UICPI). Lastly, a novel QNDSOA is utilized to optimize the UI design with an average fitness of 98.5632%. Feedback monitoring is done after optimal deployment.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.10011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The efficiency of modern machine intelligence depends on high accuracy with minimal computational cost. In spiking neural networks (SNNs), synaptic delays are crucial for encoding temporal structure, yet existing models treat them as fully trainable, unconstrained parameters, leading to large memory footprints, higher computational demand, and a departure from biological plausibility. In the brain, however, delays arise from physical distances between neurons embedded in space. Building on this principle, we introduce Spatial Spiking Neural Networks (SpSNNs), a framework in which neurons learn coordinates in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space and delays emerge from inter-neuron distances. This replaces per-synapse delay learning with position learning, substantially reducing parameter count while retaining temporal expressiveness. Across the Yin-Yang and Spiking Heidelberg Digits benchmarks, SpSNNs outperform SNNs with unconstrained delays despite using far fewer parameters. Performance consistently peaks in 2D and 3D networks rather than infinite-dimensional delay spaces, revealing a geometric regularization effect. Moreover, dynamically sparsified SpSNNs maintain full accuracy even at 90% sparsity, matching standard delay-trained SNNs while using up to 18x fewer parameters. Because learned spatial layouts map naturally onto hardware geometries, SpSNNs lend themselves to efficient neuromorphic implementation. Methodologically, SpSNNs compute exact delay gradients via automatic differentiation with custom-derived rules, supporting arbitrary neuron models and architectures. Altogether, SpSNNs provide a principled platform for exploring spatial structure in temporal computation and offer a hardware-friendly substrate for scalable, energy-efficient neuromorphic intelligence.",

    "content": "arXiv:2507.03631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from noise-corrupted electrical-circuit data, in which the correct functional form of the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that this method can recover the correct dynamics, whereas direct symbolic regression methods, such as STLSQ, fail to do so with the available data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and macroscale brain activity.",

Within neuroscience, there is growing interest in large-scale simultaneous recordings across multiple brain regions. Understanding the relationship between views (e.g., the neural activity in each region recorded) can reveal fundamental insights into each view and the system as a whole. However, existing methods to characterize such relationships lack the expressivity required to capture nonlinear relationships, describe only shared sources of variance, or discard geometric information that is crucial to drawing insights from data. Here, we present SPLICE: a neural network-based method that infers disentangled, interpretable representations of private and shared latent variables from paired samples of high-dimensional views. Compared to competing methods, we demonstrate that SPLICE 1) disentangles shared and private representations more effectively, 2) yields more interpretable representations by preserving geometry, and 3) is more robust to incorrect a priori estimates of latent dimensionality. We propose our approach as a general-purpose method for finding succinct and interpretable descriptions of paired data sets in terms of disentangled shared and private latent variables.",

With this pretraining, our contrastive learning model substantially outperforms models trained solely on classic experimental data, with gains that scale log-linearly with dataset size. Analysis of the learned representations reveals that, while brain activity represents speech features, its global structure largely drifts across days, highlighting the need for models that explicitly account for cross-day variability.

    "title": "Dynamical Mechanisms for Coordinating Long-term Working Memory Based on the Precision of Spike-timing in Cortical Neurons",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.15891v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In the last century, most sensorimotor studies of cortical neurons relied on average firing rates. Rate coding is efficient for fast sensorimotor processing that occurs within a few seconds. Much less is known about long-term working memory with a time scale of hours (Ericsson and Kintsch, 1995). The discovery of the millisecond precision of spike initiation in cortical neurons was unexpected (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995). Even more striking was the precision of spiking in vivo, in response to rapidly fluctuating sensory inputs, suggesting that neural circuits could, in principle, preserve and manipulate sensory information through spike timing. It could support spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which is triggered by the relative timing of spikes between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons in the millisecond range. What spike-timing mechanisms could regulate STDP in vivo? Cortical traveling waves have been observed across many frequency bands with high temporal precision. Traveling waves have wave fronts that could link spike timing to STDP. As a wave front passes through a cortical column, excitatory synapses on the dendrites of both pyramidal and basket cells are synchronously stimulated. Inhibitory basket cells form a calyx on pyramidal cell bodies, and inhibitory rebound following a strong transient hyperpolarization can trigger a backpropagating action potential, which arrives shortly after the excitatory inputs on pyramidal dendrites. STDP activated in this way could persist for hours, creating a second-tier network. This temporary network could support long-term working memory, a cognitive network riding above the long-term sensorimotor network. On their own, traveling waves and STDP have not yet yielded new insights into cortical function. Together, they could be responsible for how we think (Sejnowski, 2025).",

    "title": "STING_IFN_CH25H lipid axis links innate immune activation to tau pathology",
    "content": "Genetic risk for Alzheimers disease is strongly enriched in pathways governing microglial activation and cholesterol metabolism, yet how these processes converge to drive neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here, we identify the oxysterol 25_hydroxycholesterol (25_HC) as a pathogenic lipid downstream of the cGAS_STING_IFN pathway. In models of tau pathology, interferon signaling induces Cholesterol 25_hydroxylase (CH25H) expression in microglia. Ch25h deletion in female P301S mice suppressed tau aggregation, preserved synapses, prevented brain atrophy, and rescued memory. Mechanistically, loss of CH25H disrupted STING trafficking, attenuated IFN activation, dampened self-perpetuating microglial inflammation. Strikingly, 25_HC directly accelerated tau propagation in human iPSC derived neurons. It also disrupted lysosomal and mitochondrial lipid composition, driving cholesteryl ester accumulation and promoting apoptosis under tau-induced stress. These findings define a STING_IFN_CH25H lipid axis that bridges innate immune activation to tau pathology and toxicity, offering a tractable therapeutic pathway for inflammation-driven neurodegenerative conditions.",

    "content": "The quality of retinal images is compromised by aberrations that remain uncorrected even in confocal adaptive optics imaging. This study demonstrates phase diversity (PD), a computational imaging technique, to address residual aberrations and enhance image quality in adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO). By using images of the same object obtained with and without deliberately added aberrations, PD computes and compensates for the effects of existing residual aberrations beyond those corrected by a closed-loop AO system. Experimental validation demonstrates that PD improves visualization of retinal microstructures, including cone mosaics and dendrites of fluorescently labeled retinal ganglion cells (RGCs).",

    "title": "Pooled versus structured inhibition drives competitive stimulus interactions across distinct spatial scales of the superior colliculus",
    "content": "Competitive stimulus interactions across the space map in the midbrain superior colliculus (SC) are essential for spatial decision-making. Here, with electrophysiological recordings in intermediate and deep layers of the mouse SC (SCid), we discovered that rules and the spatial profiles of these competitive interactions are different between local, within-RF versus global, across-RF-boundary spatial scales. When one visual stimulus was centered in the receptive field (RF) and a second one was located within the RF's classical inhibitory surround, we found that stimulus interactions followed an averaging rule. This classical surround was spatially restricted, and the strength of inhibition underlying these 'within-RF' interactions decreased with distance from the RF center. By contrast, when the second stimulus was located outside the RF, stimulus interactions followed a divisive rule. Strikingly, this extra-classical inhibitory surround was spatially global, and the strength of competitive inhibition underlying these 'across-RF-boundary' interactions was distance-invariant. Computational modeling revealed that whereas within-RF interactions are well-explained by a divisive normalization-like mechanism driven by pooled inhibition, across-RF-boundary interactions are not, and instead, are well-explained by a winner-take-all-like mechanism driven by structured, donut-like inhibition. Combined, our results offer insights into the mechanistic logic of stimulus competition in the SCid, which critically underlies spatial decision-making in mammals.",

    "content": "Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which genetic risk variants, including APOE E4 (A+) and the PICALM rs3851179 variant (P+), are linked to altered brain function. Objective: To test whether dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) dwell-time patterns from resting-state fMRI differ by AD genetic risk in cognitively healthy, middle-aged adults. Methods: We estimated recurring dFC clusters from rs-fMRI and computed dwell-time (total time spent in each cluster) for individuals in not-at-risk, A+P-, and A+P+ groups. Group differences in dwell-time profiles were assessed, and logistic regression with permutation testing evaluated the association between dwell-time features and genotype. Results: At-risk groups (A+P-, A+P+) spent less time in left-hemisphere hubs than not-at-risk individuals, consistent with reports of left-hemisphere vulnerability in AD. Logistic regression showed modest above-chance genotype discrimination, with permutation tests indicating a marginal trend when comparing not-at-risk versus at-risk (A+P-, A+P+) groups. Conclusions: Dwell-time features from dFC states show preliminary sensitivity to AD genetic risk and warrant evaluation in larger samples as potential early risk markers.

    "title": "Multi-Timescale Neural Adaptation Failure as a Mechanistic Signature of Major Depression",
    "content": "Major depression (MD) is usually characterized in terms of momentary abnormalities, such as negative bias or emotional blunting, derived from paradigms that measure only the first response to a stimulus. Yet depressive experience in daily life is repetitive and cumulative. Here we test the hypothesis that a failure of neural adaptation across repetitions is a core feature of MD. Using a repeated negative-stimulus paradigm, we quantified adaptation at micro (within-trial) and macro (across-session) scales via electroencephalography in 28 MD patients and 34 healthy controls, measuring both conventional event-related potentials and large-scale traveling-wave propagation. MD patients exhibited pervasive maladaptation: neural rigidity at the micro scale (absent repetition suppression) and progressive regulatory depletion at the macro scale (escalating emotional reactivity with declining cognitive control). Across analyses, adaptation-based metrics revealed larger group differences than single-shot indices, and classifiers built on adaptation features-especially traveling-wave dynamics-outperformed single-shot models (task AUC = 0.83 vs 0.78) and generalized to two independent datasets (up to AUC = 0.91). These findings challenge conventional symptom-based characterizations of MD, establishing adaptation failure-not initial reactivity-as the mechanistically primary pathological signature. This reframing provides a unified mechanistic explanation for rumination and cognitive inflexibility while offering a standardized, low-cost biomarker requiring minimal electrodes ([&le;]8 channels), enabling large-scale screening in resource-limited settings.",

    "title": "Crossfrequency routing in a hippocampocortical circuit during probabilistic reversal learning",
    "content": "Learning under uncertainty requires detecting latent changes in environmental contingencies and flexibly adjusting choice strategy. To model this process and identify associated circuit dynamics, we trained rats on a two armed bandit task with uncued reward reversals while simultaneously recording local field potentials from the circuit comprised by dorsal hippocampus (CA1d), lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Behavioral performance improved with training and progressively shifted from outcome-reactive exploration to an exploitation-biased strategy, quantified using a model-free index. Mixed-effects modeling combining behavioral and neural metrics identified tonic cortical synchrony in theta and fast gamma bands as a negative session scale performance marker. Theta and gamma oscillations were coordinated, as crossregional phase amplitude coupling showed that CA1d theta phase gated fast gamma activity in PFC, while biasing both slow and fast gamma bursts in LEC, which selectively increased at goal reaching. Neuronal spiking showed crossregional phase locking to both theta and gamma rhythms, indicating synchronized timing across the hippocampo-cortical circuit. Finally, distributed neuronal spiking across the circuit represented goal approach, yet only prefrontal neurons ramped during goal-reaching, suggesting a role in outcome assessment, while hippocampal and entorhinal units transiently suppressed, consistent with locomotor tracking and resetting. These results reveal a tonic cortical connectivity marker of ongoing performance during reversal learning and dissociate it from hippocampal theta mechanisms that selectively organize cortical gamma bursts and spike timing. Together, these results provide mechanistic insight into how frequency specific hippocampocortical interactions dynamically reconfigure to support strategy transitions, offering a circuit-level framework for understanding adaptive decision making under uncertainty.",

    "title": "Mapping glioblastoma spreading: connexin43 and glial dynamic in mouse and human glioblastoma microenvironment",
    "content": "High-grade gliomas (HGGs), including astrocytoma and glioblastoma (GBM), constitute the most prevalent primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). GBM cells demonstrate a notable ability to infiltrate the brain paren-chyma, precluding complete surgical resection. Here we investigated the spreading of GBM cells and the response of the CNS microenvironment fo-cusing on glial cells, which are essential interactors to GBM. We used acute and organotypic slices from the mouse brain and peritumoral cortex of patients with HGGs. We found that human peritumoral tissue from cortical resection was characterized by high levels of the astrocytic Connex-in43 protein (Cx43) and discrete infiltration of microglia. In contrast, the tu-mor core exhibited high myeloid infiltration and an altered extracellular ma-trix (ECM) composition, which was poor in CD44. We tracked mouse and primary human-labeled-GBM cells in 2D cultures and in co-culture with or-ganotypic slices generated from mouse brain and human peritumoral tissues. We found that the implanted GBM cells infiltrated the brain tissue, implying early glial modifications including an increase in Cx43 expression and distri-bution. Furthermore, the blockage of Cx43 hemichannels was accompanied by morphological changes and polarization of human GBM cells, typical for migration phenomena. The present study sheds light on the dynamics of GBM cells spreading in the living brain tissue, suggesting that the progression of the tumor correlates with changes within the host brain. Our findings identify the upregulation of Cx43 expression as a highly consistent modification in both mouse and human tissue that may be crucial for GBM infiltration.",

    "title": "The glutamine transporter Slc38a1 is widely expressed in the embryonic neurogenic niches and impacts neuronal volume, survival, and morphology",
    "content": "The amino acid glutamine, and its derivatives glutamate and GABA, are pivotal for neurogenesis. However, how glutamine is mechanistically supplied to the cells in the neurogenic niches and its broader impact on neurodevelopment, remain poorly characterized. The Solute carrier family 38 member 1 (Slc38a1) exhibits high affinity for glutamine and accumulates glutamine in select cells. We investigated whether Slc38a1 is essential for neurogenesis and whether it has an impact on brain structure and function. Slc38a1 mRNA transcript and protein are widely expressed in the embryonic brain, including in the dorsal pallium and sub-pallium. At embryonic day 15.5, Slc38a1 localizes in neuronal stem cells in the ventricular zone in the forebrain, while it localizes in mature neurons in the sub-ventricular zone of the hindbrain. In the adult brain, Slc38a1 is not detected in neuronal stem cells in the sub-granular zone, however, it is highly enriched in mature local parvalbumin+ and somatostatin+ interneurons and ependyma. Analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data further reveal that both the number of Slc38a1-expressing cells and the average transcript level of Slc38a1 are significantly higher in embryo brain cells compared to adults. In the embryo, Slc38a1 transcripts are particularly enriched in immature neuronal lineages and embryonic oligodendrocyte precursor populations, whereas in the adult, expression is more prominent in neural progenitor cells and radial glia. Disruption of Slc38a1 in mice impacts body weight, brain size and glutamatergic neuronal volume, while dendritic arborization is diminished and cellular life span is shortened. Altogether, Slc38a1 is essential for normal neurodevelopment, indirectly regulates adult neurogenesis in the sub-granular zone and influence neuronal morphology and cell viability.",

    "content": "Studies on first-year infants' pitch perception have witnessed shifts of perceptual focus from acoustic to linguistic information and from a wide range of contrasts to those relevant to their native language. Nevertheless, how linguistic experience interacts with this developmental process remains an open question. This study compared the neural discrimination of speech/lexical and nonspeech/violin tone contrasts by 5- to 6- and 11- to 12-month-old infants across three types of language backgrounds: monolingual infants learning a non-tone language (Mono), bilingual infants learning two non-tone languages (Bi-NT), and bilingual infants learning a non-tone and a tone language (Bi-Tone). Although Mono infants do not show significant responses to the lexical tone contrast, both Bi-NT and Bi-Tone infants showed positive mismatch responses at both ages, indicating an enhancement effect brought by a complex language environment as early as 5 months after birth. Regarding the violin tone perception, distinct patterns were observed across language backgrounds: a perceptual decrease for Mono infants, no significant response for Bi-NT infants, and a perceptual increase for Bi-Tone infants over the first year. These patterns suggest that pitch perception may be affected across domains by language experiences at this stage, where interactions in cognitive processing between speech and nonspeech prosodic information may occur.",

    "content": "The ability to adapt to varying task demands is essential for goal-directed behavior. Cognitive control styles regulate this adaptation, with persistence reflecting high top\u2013down control and flexibility reflecting lower control. Metacontrol facilitates the dynamic adjustment between these states based on current demands. The present study investigated short-term feedback-dependent adaptations in cognitive control style during conflict monitoring. Behavioral results demonstrated that RT feedback promoted a more persistent cognitive control style in subsequent trials, improving performance in incongruent conditions while diminishing facilitative effects in congruent conditions. On the neurophysiological level, theta-band activity primarily reflected these changes during conflict processing. Crucially, intertrial interval analyses revealed a key role of beta-band activity in using RT feedback. Correlations with behavioral congruency effects suggested that decreased beta-band activity reflected a generally more flexible control style, whereas increased beta-band activity was associated with generally greater persistence. By demonstrating that pretrial beta-band modulations reflect cognitive control dispositions, this study provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying metacontrol.",

    "title": "The Role of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep in Neural Differentiation of Memories in the Hippocampus",
    "content": "When faced with a familiar situation, we can use memory to make predictions about what will happen next. If such predictions turn out to be erroneous, the brain can adapt by differentiating the representations of the cue from the mispredicted item itself, reducing the likelihood of future prediction errors. Prior work by Kim, G., Norman, K. A., and Turk-Browne, N. B. Neural differentiation of incorrectly predicted memories. Journal of Neuroscience, 37, 2022\u20132031 [2017] found that violating a sequential association in a statistical learning paradigm triggered differentiation of the neural representations of the associated items in the hippocampus. Here, we used fMRI to test the preregistered hypothesis that this hippocampal differentiation occurs only when violations are followed by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Participants first learned that some items predict others (e.g., A predicts B) and then encountered a violation in which a predicted item (B) failed to appear when expected after its associated item (A); the predicted item later appeared on its own after an unrelated item. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three conditions: remain awake, take a nap containing non-REM sleep only, or take a nap with both non-REM and REM sleep. While the predicted results were not observed in the preregistered left CA2/3/dentate gyrus (DG) ROI, we did observe evidence for our hypothesis in closely related hippocampal ROIs, uncorrected for multiple comparisons: In right CA2/3/DG, differentiation in the group with REM sleep was greater than in the groups without REM sleep (wake and non-REM nap); this differentiation was item-specific and concentrated in right DG. REM-related differentiation effects were also greater in bilateral DG when the predicted item was more strongly reactivated during the violation. Overall, these results provide initial evidence linking REM sleep to changes in the hippocampal representations of memories in humans.",

    "title": "Scene-sensitive Medial Temporal Lobe Subregions Are Recruited for the Integration of Non-scene Stimuli",
    "content": "A hallmark feature of episodic memory is the ability to flexibly recombine information across episodes to form new associations and guide behavior. This process, termed associative inference, relies on the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. We previously found that cross-episode binding was improved when episodes were linked by scenes rather than by faces or objects. Here, we tested whether differential recruitment of category-sensitive MTL subregions underlies these behavioral differences. Participants completed study-test phases of the Associative Inference in Memory task while undergoing fMRI scanning. During the study phase, they encoded overlapping AB and BC pairs. A and C items were always objects. The linking B item was either a face or a scene. At test, memory for the direct (AB, BC) and indirect associations (inferred AC) was tested. Category sensitivity in MTL subregions was tested using an independent functional localizer and the low integration (AB) trials from the study phase of the Associative Inference in Memory task. Within the MTL, no subregions exhibited face sensitivity. The anterior hippocampal head, anterolateral and posteromedial entorhinal cortices, and parahippocampal cortex were identified as scene sensitive. Although accuracy of the indirect inferences did not differ between pairs linked by faces and scenes, MTL subregion recruitment differed across categories. Scene-sensitive subregions in MTL cortex (anterolateral entorhinal cortex, posteromedial entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex), but not the hippocampus (anterior hippocampal head), were recruited to support associative inference for faces during encoding. These findings suggest that regions in MTL cortex identified as scene sensitive here may be involved in integrating disparate elements of episodes into coherent representations, and may be recruited for non-scene stimuli when integration demands during encoding are high (e.g., during associative inference).",

    "title": "Increasing Signal, Reducing Noise: Contrasting Neural Mechanisms of Attention in Visual Search",
    "content": "When invariant target\u2013distractor arrays are presented repeatedly during visual search, participants respond faster on repeated versus novel configuration trials. This effect reflects attentional guidance through long-term memory (LTM) templates\u2014a phenomenon termed contextual cueing. Subsequently, relocating the target within the same distractor layout abolishes any contextual cueing effects, and relearning the new target position is much harder than the initial learning\u2014likely due to consistent attentional misguidance toward the initial (learned) target position. Here, we studied how the different processes involved in contextual cueing and relearning affect the variability of neural responses in human participants as measured with EEG. Attention has previously been shown to reduce trial-by-trial variability in EEG [Arazi, A., Yeshurun, Y., & Dinstein, I. Neural variability is quenched by attention. Journal of Neuroscience, 39, 5975\u20135985, 2019], indicating that, in addition to increasing the neural response to an attended stimulus, attention may reduce the noise within the neural response itself. While repeated versus novel contexts did not modulate the trial-by-trial variability during initial learning, significant lateralized variability reductions were observed for repeated but not novel context trials in the relocations phase. This contrasts with how contextual cueing affected lateralized ERPs in past research. Zinchenko and colleagues [Zinchenko, A., Conci, M., T\u00f6llner, T., M\u00fcller, H. J., & Geyer, T. Automatic guidance (and misguidance) of visuospatial attention by acquired scene memory: Evidence from an N1pc polarity reversal. Psychological Science, 31, 1531\u20131543, 2020] found that lateralized ERPs signal correct and incorrect (i.e., misguided) attentional selection of target positions learned earlier. This phenomenon was observed during both the learning and relocation phases. Thus, variability and lateralized ERPs may represent different facets of attention, where variability becomes evident specifically under high attentional demand conditions, such as when participants must override the misguidance caused by LTM templates.",

    "content": "Graphical representations of quantitative data abound in our culture, and yet the brain mechanisms of graphicacy, by which viewers quickly extract statistical information from a data graphic, are unknown. Here, using scatterplots as stimuli, we tested two hypotheses about the brain areas underlying graphicacy. First, at the perceptual level, we hypothesized that the visual processing of scatterplots and their main trend recycles cortical regions devoted to the perception of the principal axis of objects. Second, at a higher level, we speculated that the math-responsive network active during arithmetic and mathematical truth judgments should also be involved in graphical perception. Using fMRI, we indeed found that the judgment of the trend in a scatterplot recruits a right lateral occipital area involved in detecting the orientation of objects, as well as a right anterior intraparietal region also recruited during mathematical tasks. Both behavior and brain activity were driven by the t value that indexes the statistical correlation in the data, and right intraparietal activation covaried with participants' graphicacy level. On the basis of this first approach to the neural bases of graphical perception, we suggest that, like literacy and numeracy, graphicacy relies on the recycling of brain areas previously attuned to a similar problem, here the perception of object orientation.",

    "content": "Predictive processing plays a central role in language comprehension, allowing listeners to generate predictions about upcoming linguistic input. Although considerable evidence supports segmental prediction, less is known about whether listeners can form predictions about suprasegmental features such as lexical tone. This study investigates whether listeners can generate and neurally represent predicted tonal information in the absence of auditory input. Using a Mandarin Chinese tone sandhi paradigm, we established tonal predictions based on sentence and visual context, recording brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Multivariate pattern analysis showed that predicted tonal categories could be decoded from brain activity even without tonal stimuli present. These representations were localized in auditory areas, articulatory motor regions, and the right cerebellum. We also found that predicted tone representations had distinct neural substrates compared to perceived tone representations. The study provides direct neural evidence that listeners can form representations of lexical tone in predictions of auditory input. The findings expand our understanding of suprasegmental prediction in speech and highlight the cerebellum's role in linguistic prediction.",

    "title": "Typical Perceptual Sensitivity to Changes in Interpersonal Distance in Developmental Prosopagnosia",
    "content": "Social perception research has traditionally sought to elucidate the visual processing engaged by the faces and bodies of individuals. Recently, however, there has been growing interest in how we perceive dyadic interactions between people. Early findings suggest that dyads arranged face-to-face may engage neurocognitive processing similar to that recruited by faces. Given these parallels, we sought to determine whether individuals with developmental prosopagnosa (DP), who exhibit lifelong face recognition difficulties, also exhibit impaired perception of facing dyads. The focus of our investigation was interpersonal distance\u2014a key visual feature of dyadic social interactions. Participants completed three distance change detection tasks. Two of the tasks depicted distance changes during dyadic social interactions (fighting and dancing). A third task depicted distance changes using nonsocial objects (a pair of grandfather clocks). If DP is associated with impoverished perception of dyadic interactions, we reasoned that individuals with DP should exhibit diminished sensitivity to distance changes on the dancers task and the boxers task, but not on the clocks task. Contrary to this prediction, however, individuals with DP and typical controls did not differ significantly in their ability to detect distance changes on any of the tasks. Although the visual processing of faces and facing dyads exhibit certain similarities, these findings suggest that the underlying perceptual mechanisms may dissociate.",

    "content": "Although there is a rapidly growing interest in reward\u2013emotion interactions, our current understanding of how negative emotion influences reward motivation and modulates reward-driven enhancements in visual perception remains limited. To address these gaps, we conducted an fMRI study using a novel variant of the monetary incentive delay task where the valence (negative or neutral) of an emotional scene image served as a cue to indicate a reward or no-reward prospect in the subsequent house\u2013building discrimination task. During the initial cue stage, we hypothesized competitive interactions between reward anticipation and negative emotion along the common value/valence dimension. However, we instead found independent neural signatures of reward (vs. no-reward) anticipation in the ventral striatum and negative (vs. neutral) emotion in the ventromedial pFC and amygdala, with a lack of evidence for their interaction. Notably, during the subsequent task stage, we detected an Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), wherein reward-driven enhancements in task-related processing were attenuated in the case of negative (vs. neutral) cue images. Furthermore, the Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction scores in PHG and behavioral RTs were correlated across participants. Finally, a regression analysis revealed that negative valence-related activity in ventromedial pFC moderated the relationship between ventral striatum reward anticipation activity and PHG task-related processing. These findings demonstrate that negative emotion and reward motivation, which were largely segregated during the cue stage, interactively modulated subsequent visual perception, thus potentially influencing behavior.",

    "content": "Crowding is a phenomenon in which visual object identification is impaired by the close proximity of other stimuli. The neural processes leading to object recognition and its breakdown as seen in crowding are still debated. To assess how crowding affects the processing of stimuli in visual cortex, we recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by flickering target and flanker stimuli while manipulating the spacing of these stimuli (Experiment 1) as well as target similarity (Experiment 2). Participants who performed an orientation discrimination task while proportion correct, along with frequency-tagged SSVEPs elicited by target and flanker stimuli, were recorded. Decreasing target\u2013flanker distance reduced both behavioral performance and target-elicited SSVEP amplitudes. Estimates of the critical spacing, a measure of the spatial extent of crowding, from both behavioral data and SSVEP amplitudes were similar. In addition, manipulating target similarity affected both measures in the same way. These findings establish a clear connection between the suppression of stimulus processing by nearby flankers in visual cortex and crowding, and demonstrate the usefulness of SSVEPs in studying the cortical mechanisms of visual crowding.",

    "content": "The traditional view of modality-specific brain organization has been challenged by demonstrations of cross-modal processing, i.e. the activation of sensory cortex by atypical sensory input. An alternative theory suggests that rather than specializing simply in different sensory modalities, different parts of the cortex can specialize in different types of tasks. We recently addressed this question in the olfactory domain, showing that in normosmic individuals, the primary olfactory cortex (piriform cortex) responds to unimodal auditory and visual objects, regardless of how strongly they are associated with an odor. Here, we assess whether previous olfactory experience is a prerequisite for this cross-modal processing in the piriform cortex, using a unique group of individuals born without a sense of smell (congenital anosmia; CA; n = 30). First, we were able to confirm the presence of clear visual and auditory activations in the piriform cortex of these sensory deprived individuals. As compared to normosmic controls (n = 30), these activations and associated functional connectivity, both within the piriform cortices and between piriform cortex and other regions, were altered in a modality dependent way. Our results show that life-long absence of olfactory input does not impede cross-modal activations by visual and auditory objects in the piriform cortex and are compatible with the idea of a task-based rather than modality-specific organization of this brain region.",

    "content": "<p>Hi HN, we\u2019re Luke and Phillip, and we\u2019re building Spice.ai OSS - a lightweight, portable data and AI engine and powered by Apache DataFusion & Ballista for SQL query, hybrid-search, and LLM-inference across disaggregated-storage used by enterprises like Barracuda Networks and Twilio.<p>We first introduced Spice [1] on HN in 2021 and re-launched it on HN [2] in 2024 re-built from the ground up in Rust.<p>Spice includes the concept of a Data Accelerator [3], which is a way to materialize data from disparate sources, such as other databases, in embedded databases like SQLite and DuckDB.<p>Today we\u2019re excited to announce a new Ducklake-inspired Data Accelerator built on Vortex [3], a highly performant, extensible columnar data format that claims 100x faster random access, 10-20x faster scans, 5x faster writes with a similar compression ratio vs. Apache Parquet.<p>In our tests with Spice, Vortex performs faster than DuckDB with a third of the memory usage, and is much more scalable (multi-file). For real-world deployments, we see the DuckDB Data Accelerator often capping out around 1TB, but Spice Cayenne can do Petabyte-scale.<p>You can read about it at <a href=\"https://spice.ai/blog\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://spice.ai/blog</a> and in the Spice OSS release notes [4].<p>This is just the first version, and we\u2019d love to get your feedback!<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28448887\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28448887</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39854584\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39854584</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https://spiceai.org/blog/releases/v1.9.0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://spiceai.org/blog/releases/v1.9.0</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46316991\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46316991</a></p>\n<p>Points: 21</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",

    "title": "Task-Dependent Motor Unit Recruitment and Rate Coding Reveal Redistribution of Neural Drive in the Human Hand",
    "content": "Although Henneman's size principle dictates an orderly small-to-large activation, evidence suggests a certain level of flexibility in the recruitment of spinal motor neurons depending on task demands. Here, we investigate motor unit (MU) recruitment flexibility in the human first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle while controlling for overall muscle activation across two functionally distinct tasks using high-density intramuscular EMG (HD-iEMG) electrode arrays. Six participants performed isometric index finger abduction where the FDI serves as the prime mover, and flexion with the FDI functioning as a synergist. Recruitment thresholds (RTs) and recruitment orders (ROs) were highly consistent within the same task, but differed significantly between abduction and flexion. Across participants, 45.3% of MUs showed changes in recruitment above the coefficient of repeatability across tasks compared to only 5.0% within tasks. Changes in RT were accompanied by corresponding adaptations in discharge rate (DR), preserving the inverse RT-DR relationship. MU size did not have an effect on recruitment variability. Intramuscular coherence analysis revealed no differences in the delta (1-5 Hz) or alpha (5-13 Hz) band, but beta band (13-30 Hz) coherence was significantly lower during flexion than abduction, indicating reduced high-frequency inputs when FDI serves as a synergist muscle. Together, these results indicate different distributions of net excitatory input to FDI MUs across different functional tasks, that may include stronger involvement of spinal circuits during flexion as opposed to abduction, as indicated by the reduced intramuscular beta coherence. Moreover, the present findings also demonstrate that common synaptic input and not intrinsic motor neuron properties determines the inverse relation between MU RT and DR.",

    "content": "<p>Hi HN,\nWe are the OpenDCAI group from Peking University. We built Paper2Any, an open-source tool designed to automate the \"Paper to Slides\" workflow based on our DataFlow-Agent framework.\nThe Problem: Writing papers is hard, but creating professional architecture diagrams and slides (PPTs) is often more tedious. Most AI tools just generate static images (PNGs) that are impossible to tweak for final publication.\nThe Solution: Paper2Any takes a PDF, text, or sketch as input, understands the research logic, and generates fully editable PPTX (PowerPoint) files and SVGs. We prioritize flexibility and fidelity\u2014allowing you to specify page ranges, switch visual styles, and preserve original assets.\nHow it works:\n1. Multimodal Reading: Extracts text and visual elements from the paper. You can now specify page ranges (e.g., Method section only) to focus the context and reduce token usage.\n2. Content Understanding: Identifies core contributions and structural logic.\n3. PPT Generation: Instead of generating one flat image, it generates independent elements (blocks, arrows, text) with selectable visual styles and organizes them into a slide layout.\nLinks:\n- Demo: <a href=\"http://dcai-paper2any.cpolar.top/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dcai-paper2any.cpolar.top/</a>\n- Code (DataFlow-Agent): <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow-Agent\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow-Agent</a>\nWe'd love to hear your feedback on the generation quality and the agent workflow!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46315047\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46315047</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "title": "Pathway Anchored Multimodal Clustering Reveals Circuit Level Signatures in Parkinsons Disease",
    "content": "Parkinson's disease is increasingly understood as a disorder of distributed brain circuits, yet most imaging analyses do not explicitly respect pathway structure. We introduce a pathway anchored, multimodal clustering framework based on Scalable Robust Variational Compositional Co-clustering (SRVCC) that integrates structural MRI, free water corrected diffusion MRI, and DAT-SPECT in anatomically defined circuits. For each pathway, we derive a simple Multimodal Pathway Integrity Score (MPIS) that aggregates z normalised volume, microstructural, and dopaminergic measures into an interpretable summary of imaging integrity. In the PPMI cohort, SRVCC identifies stable imaging-derived patient clusters and feature modules under explicit model selection and bootstrap/stability checks, with covariate-adjusted analyses controlling for age, sex, education, medication, and scanner. MPIS shows coherent but modest structure function associations: lower nigrostriatal and frontostriatal integrity relates to higher motor burden (UPDRS-III), while reduced sensory/visuospatial and limbic integrity is linked to lower global cognition (MoCA); microvascular markers robustly stratify imaging profiles but display minimal cross-sectional coupling to these global scales. Feature-level reports highlight dominant region by modality contributors (e.g., striatal DAT-SBR, thalamic and cerebellar morphology, white-matter hyperintensity metrics), providing a transparent bridge from multimodal data to circuit-level signatures. This pathway-aware representation offers a principled, reproducible way to summarise multimodal imaging in PD and may support future work on circuit-informed stratification, prognosis, and targeted outcome measures.",

    "title": "The Role of Temporal Factors in Processing Rapid Serial Visual Presentations",
    "content": "Sequentially presented visual stimuli are often employed to investigate the temporal limits of our visual perception and attention. Due to the finite nature of the brains' processing capacity, experimental designs attempt to increase temporal separation within series to mitigate potential neural interference between stimuli. This is achieved through shortening of stimulus durations and lengthening of interstimulus intervals. Across two experiments, we parametrically varied these parameters for a serially presented checkerboard wedge stimulus and used inverted encoding modelling to assess the fidelity of the neural representation of spatial location. We found longer interstimulus intervals and shorter stimulus durations produced the most reliable decoding. Varying interstimulus interval altered the fidelity of neural representations via inter-item interference. By contrast, the influence of stimulus duration seemed largely analytic; in a fixed duration block, shorter stimulus duration enabled more presentations, which led to increased decoding accuracy. Distinct anticipatory and reactionary neural events were observed for stimuli presented in triplet sequences, which seemed consistent with forwards and backwards visual masking. The absence of an anticipatory event was observed when backward masking was stronger while a reactionary event was present for every stimulus subjected to forward masking.",

    "content": "Developing peripheral blood-based diagnostic models for idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD), particularly those leveraging the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, has long been considered infeasible because patient-derived TCRs appear to lack convergent sequence motifs. We reasoned that this apparent absence of shared TCR features likely reflects both insufficient sample sizes and unaccounted immune heterogeneity within the iPD population. To overcome these barriers, we reconstructed TCR repertoires from the two largest iPD cohorts currently available and used three mechanistically distinct mouse models as etiologically informed anchors to molecularly stratify patients. Within these data-driven subtypes, we trained subtype-specific, multimodal multi-instance classifiers, achieving Area Under Curve (AUC) exceeding 0.8 for both subtypes. Our findings underscore the critical role of disease stratification in enabling TCR repertoire-based modeling in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "title": "CNN-based framework for Alzheimer's disease detection from EEG via dynamic mode decomposition",
    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

    "content": "The logopenic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (lvPPA) is marked by phonological short-term memory deficits that compromise repetition and communication. While previous interventions in PPA have primarily targeted lexical-semantic abilities, little is known about therapies that directly address phonological impairments, primarily through teletherapy. This first study investigated the efficacy of an intensive phonological short-term memory training program delivered via teletherapy in individuals with the lvPPA. The intervention aimed to improve repetition of trained items, promote generalization to untrained items, facilitate transfer to functional tasks, and ensure maintenance over time. In the present study, significant improvements were observed in both immediate and delayed repetition of trained items, with partial short-term generalization to untrained items, particularly for words in delayed tasks. No substantial generalization effects were observed for functional language tasks, including picture description and picture naming, suggesting that the intervention\u2019s impact may remain task specific. Individual trajectories revealed heterogeneous responses, potentially influenced by baseline cognitive profiles, spontaneous strategies, or fatigue. Mixed-effects models confirmed that interindividual factors explained a substantial portion of the variance. These findings support the feasibility and clinical relevance of remote phonological training in the lvPPA and underline the importance of early, personalized interventions. The study also raises the hypothesis that delayed repetition may facilitate internal rehearsal, enhancing generalization. Further research is needed to assess broader functional outcomes and optimize protocol scalability.",

    "title": "Untangling cross-regional cross-frequency coupling in dynamic neural oscillations",
    "content": "Objective. Brain networks communicate through long range phase coupling of low frequency oscillations (LFOs, less than 35 Hz) between brain regions. At the same time, phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling (CFC), in which the phase of the same LFO have been shown to modulate the power of high frequency activity has also been reported across brain regions as a critical regulator of neural activity and excitability. While cross-regional CFC has been reported as a potential mechanism of long-distance modulation of neural excitability, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has yet to be understood and methods to dissociate the effect of local vs remote LFO have not been developed. Cross-regional CFC can be a result of either LFOs in one region directly modulating high frequency oscillations in another region or due to a chain effect, in which apparent cross-regional CFC results from coupling of LFO across sites. Approach. A novel method of partial modulation index (PMI) is proposed as a derivation of modulation index (MI) and based on Pearl\u2019s do-calculus to remove the mathematical bias of simultaneous phase coupling and CFC measurements. Here, we first test the PMI on a simulated dataset, showing it can differentiate between biased and unbiased CFC. We then evaluate the method on intracranially collected local field potentials recorded simultaneously from thalamus and cortex in a patient undergoing deep brain stimulator implantation for essential tremor, demonstrating that the observed thalamocortical CFC was partially biased. Main results. For both simulated and human datasets, the PMI was compared to the conventional MI. In simulated data, the PMI was able to disentangle cross-regional phase coupling and focal CFC which is not possible using conventional MI. While there is no ground truth for comparison in human data, the results from the simulated data demonstrate the value of the proposed method in removing mathematical bias. Significance. This novel method facilitates a mathematically rigorous characterization of residual CFC, enabling investigations of differential contributions and roles of brain-wide LFO to CFC, which can lead to a more complete understanding of the pathophysiology of neurological processes and disorders.",

    "title": "Launch HN: Pulse (YC S24) \u2013 Production-grade unstructured document extraction",
    "content": "<p>Hi HN, we\u2019re Sid and Ritvik, co-founders of Pulse. Pulse is a document extraction system to create LLM-ready text. We built Pulse as we realized that although modern vision language models are very good at producing plausible text, that makes them risky for OCR and data ingestion at scale.<p>When we started working on document extraction, we assumed the same thing many teams do today: foundation models were improving quickly, multi modal systems appeared to read documents well, and for small or clean inputs that assumption often held. The limitations showed up once we began processing real documents in volume. Long PDFs, dense tables, mixed layouts, low-fidelity scans, and financial or operational data exposed errors that were subtle, hard to detect, and expensive to correct. Outputs often looked reasonable while containing small but meaningful mistakes, especially in tables and numeric fields.<p>A lot of our work since then has been applied research. We run controlled evaluations on complex documents, fine tune vision models, and build labeled datasets where ground truth actually matters. There have been many nights where our team stayed up hand annotating pages, drawing bounding boxes around tables, labeling charts point by point, or debating whether a number was unreadable or simply poorly scanned. That process shaped our intuition far more than benchmarks alone.<p>One thing became clear quickly. The core challenge was not extraction itself, but confidence. Vision language models embed document images into high-dimensional representations optimized for semantic understanding rather than precise transcription. That process is inherently lossy. When uncertainty appears, models tend to resolve it using learned priors instead of surfacing ambiguity. This behavior can be helpful in consumer settings. In production pipelines, it creates verification problems that do not scale well.<p>Pulse grew out of trying to address this gap through system design rather than prompting alone. Instead of treating document understanding as a single generative step, the system separates layout analysis from language modeling. Documents are normalized into structured representations that preserve hierarchy and tables before schema mapping occurs. Extraction is constrained by schemas defined ahead of time, and extracted values are tied back to source locations so uncertainty can be inspected rather than guessed away. In practice, this results in a hybrid approach that combines traditional computer vision techniques, layout models, and vision language models, because no single approach handled these cases reliably on its own.<p>We are intentionally sharing a few documents that reflect the types of inputs that motivated this work. These are representative of cases where we saw generic OCR or VLM-based pipelines struggle.<p>Here is a financial 10K:\n<a href=\"https://platform.runpulse.com/dashboard/examples/example1\">https://platform.runpulse.com/dashboard/examples/example1</a><p>Here is a newspaper:\n<a href=\"https://platform.runpulse.com/dashboard/examples/example2\">https://platform.runpulse.com/dashboard/examples/example2</a><p>Here is a rent roll: <a href=\"https://platform.runpulse.com/dashboard/examples/example3\">https://platform.runpulse.com/dashboard/examples/example3</a><p>Pulse is not perfect, particularly on highly degraded scans or uncommon handwriting, and there is still room for improvement. The goal is not to eliminate errors entirely, but to make them visible, auditable, and easier to reason about.<p>Pulse is available via usage-based access to the API and platform You can try it here and access the API docs here.<p>Demo link here: <a href=\"https://video.runpulse.com/video/pulse-platform-walkthrough-69f9\">https://video.runpulse.com/video/pulse-platform-walkthrough-...</a><p>We\u2019re interested in hearing how others here evaluate correctness for document extraction, which failure modes you have seen in practice, and what signals you rely on to decide whether an output can be trusted.

    "title": "Measuring mild cognitive impairment whole-brain electroencephalography phase-amplitude coupling connectivity using polar mutual information",
    "content": "Objective. A novel phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) estimator is proposed to address the limitations of existing PAC estimators in terms of insufficient application scenarios. Approach. The polar mutual information (PoMI) method is compared with the currently dominant PAC estimators, mean vector length, Kullback\u2013Libler distance, general linear model, and phase-locking value, focusing on analyzing its characteristics in terms of coupling strength sensitivity, data length dependency, noise resistance, and coupling frequency band sensitivity. We recruited 54 healthy controls and 41 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and assessed their cognitive level and whole-brain PAC connectivity by neurophysiological tests and resting electroencephalography, respectively. Main results. The PoMI algorithm is sensitive to changes in coupling strength, exhibits low dependence on data length, is insensitive to noise variations, and produces stable computational outcomes. Therefore, the PoMI algorithm can quantify the PAC phenomenon in neural oscillations. Furthermore, reduced PAC connectivity in the frontal lobe of patients with MCI, while PAC activity is enhanced in the parietal and occipital lobes. The results indicate that alterations in prefrontal PAC connectivity in MCI patients may represent one manifestation of neuronal group degeneration in the prefrontal cortex of these individuals. Significance. The PoMI algorithm can effectively evaluate the PAC phenomenon in neural oscillations and can be used as a PAC estimator. (Approved No. of ethic committee: 2024-P2-210-02).",

    "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
    "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

    "content": "APOE is the greatest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). In humans, APOE has three isoforms: APOE2 (E2), APOE3 (E3), and APOE4 (E4); E4 increases AD risk, while E3 is neutral and E2 decreases risk. In the brain, APOE is predominantly produced by astrocytes, where it binds lipids to form HDL-like particles, and plays a central role in lipid homeostasis, A{beta} clearance, and neuroimmune modulation. Its lipidation state is critical for function, with E4 being poorly lipidated compared to E2 and E3, contributing to the pathogenic effects of E4 while also offering a potential therapeutic target. We have previously demonstrated that the HDL-mimetic peptide 4F increases APOE secretion and lipidation in wild-type mouse astrocytes and counteracts the inhibitory effects of A{beta}42. Here, we assessed the ability of 4F to mitigate E4-associated dysfunction using primary astrocytes from humanized E3 and E4 knock-in mice and isogenic human iPSC-derived astrocytes and cerebral organoids. Results showed that 4F enhanced APOE secretion and lipidation in both cellular and organoid models in the absence or presence of aggregated A{beta}42. Compared to E3 astrocytes, E4 astrocytes were prone to A{beta}42-induced inhibition of APOE secretion and lipidation and increased accumulation of lipid droplets. 4F treatment ameliorated the inhibitory effects of A{beta}42 and reduced lipid droplet accumulation. These findings support the therapeutic potential of HDL-mimetic peptides for E4-associated dysfunction in AD.",

    "title": "Thermal lensing during infrared neural stimulation enables spatially resolved photothermal dosimetry",
    "content": "Photothermal laser tissue interactions are challenging to study at the subcellular level due to the complexity of accurately characterizing spatial energy distributions. Infrared (IR) neural stimulation, a label-free photothermal neuromodulation technique using pulsed IR light, has demonstrated promise but lacks standardized, high-resolution dosimetry methods. Objective. In this study, we present an automated, imaging-based workflow to perform spatially resolved photothermal dosimetry. This method uses thermal lensing to mark the location of IR exposure within the imaging field of view, enabling precise assessment of the radiant exposure dosage and correlated neuronal responses. Approach. Neuronal Ca2+responses to single IR pulses of varying duration (350 \u00b5s, 2 ms, and 8 ms) were measured using widefield fluorescence microscopy. The thermal lensing artifact (TLA) observed during stimulation was used to model the spatial energy distribution of the laser beam profile. Neuronal Ca2+ responses were analyzed relative to the local radiant exposure, H0(x,y), and the average radiant exposure, dosage, Havg, calculated using the laser pulse energy divided by the laser spot area. Main results. The TLA provided a reliable fiducial for tracking the IR stimulus within the imaging field. Neuronal responses to INS were spatially dependent and exhibited three phenotypes: unreactive, low-amplitude, and high-amplitude. The Gaussian laser beam profile led to cells near the beam center receiving higher radiant exposure dosages, exceeding activation thresholds. We find that shorter pulse durations required lower radiant exposure dosages to elicit neuronal responses. The Havg consistently underestimates the radiant exposure required for stimulation. The H0(x,y) required for stimulation did not produce measurable cellular damage. Significance. Local radiant exposure dosage dictates neuronal activation during INS. Our method provides a standardized, high-throughput approach for performing spatially resolved photothermal dosimetry at microscopic level.",

    "content": "Objective. Damage to the peripheral nerves frequently leads to significant impairments in their functional capacity, highlighting the need for effective treatments that can facilitate nerve repair. This study explores the potential of grape skin extract (Ex), alone and in combination with zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs), to enhance regeneration following sciatic nerve injury (SNI) in rats. Approach. ZnO NPs were synthesized using both a conventional chemical route and a green synthesis method in which Ex served as a natural reducing and capping agent. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, Thermogravimetric analysis, Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, zeta potential, and Gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry analyses to confirm the role of Ex in shaping nanoparticle morphology and surface properties. Functional recovery and histological outcomes were then assessed in a murine SNI model. Main results. Treatment with Ex and ZnO/Ex significantly reduced collagen accumulation, fibrosis, and tissue vacuolization compared to untreated controls. Both interventions also improved myelination and enhanced the sciatic function index, indicating improved neural repair. Significance. These findings demonstrate that Ex and ZnO/Ex promote nerve regeneration and highlight their potential as promising candidates for the development of biogenic nanotherapeutics targeting peripheral nerve injuries.",

    "title": "Incorporating multi-modal prompt learning into foundation models enhances predictability of visual fMRI responses to dynamic natural stimuli",
    "content": "Objective. Modeling neural encoding of visual stimuli often uses deep neural networks (DNNs) to predict human brain response to external stimuli. However, each DNN depends on networks tailored for computer vision tasks, resulting in suboptimal brain correspondence. On the other hand, when end-to-end optimizing the encoding process for specific brain regions, challenges like training difficulties arise. Additionally, these models mostly focus on visual information processing, while the human brain integrates multi-modal information such as language to achieve a comprehensive understanding. Approach. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal prompt learning (PL) model for neural encoding of dynamic natural stimuli. Specifically, we leverage the powerful representation ability of pre-trained foundation models and fine-tune them using our multi-modal prompts. These prompts, which include textual and visual prompts tailored to each specific regions of interest, can adapt foundation models to neural encoding tasks with fewer trainable parameters. We use the CLIP For video Clip retrieval (CLIP4clip) and Video Masked Autoencoder V2 (videoMAEv2) for feature extraction with backbone freezing, refine the representations via PL, and map the fused multi-modal features to predict voxel-wise brain responses. Main results. Extensive experiments on two functional magnetic resonance imaging video datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing fine-tuning methods and public models. Significance. This work highlights the potential of prompt-based fine-tuning strategies in bridging the gap between foundation models and neural encoding tasks.",

    "title": "Super-resolution microscopy and deep learning methods: what can they bring to neuroscience: from neuron to 3D spine segmentation",
    "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",
